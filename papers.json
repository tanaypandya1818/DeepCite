        "abstract": "Advances in technology and artificial intelligence (smart healthcare) open up a range of possibilities for precision intervention in the field of health sciences. The objectives of this study were to analyse the functionality of using supervised (prediction and classification) and unsupervised (clustering) machine learning techniques to analyse results related to the development of functional skills in patients at developmental ages of 0–6 years. We worked with a sample of 113 patients, of whom 49 were cared for in a specific centre for people with motor impairments (Group 1) and 64 were cared for in a specific early care programme for patients with different impairments (Group 2). The results indicated that in Group 1, chronological age predicted the development of functional skills at 85% and in Group 2 at 65%. The classification variable detected was functional development in the upper extremities. Two clusters were detected within each group that allowed us to determine the patterns of functional development in each patient with respect to functional skills. The use of smart healthcare resources has a promising future in the field of early care. However, data recording in web applications needs to be planned, and the automation of results through machine learning techniques is required.",

        "title": "Prediction of the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides and antimicrobial agents via supervised machine learning",
        "abstract": "Background Infectious diseases not only cause severe health problems but also burden the healthcare system. Therefore, the effective treatment of those diseases is crucial. Both conventional approaches, such as antimicrobial agents, and novel approaches, like antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), are used to treat infections. However, due to the drawbacks of current approaches, new solutions are still being investigated. One recent approach is the use of AMPs and antimicrobial agents in combination, but determining synergism is with a huge variety of AMPs time-consuming and requires multiple experimental studies. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely used to predict biological outcomes, particularly in the field of AMPs, but no previous research reported on predicting the synergistic effects of AMPs and antimicrobial agents. Results Several supervised ML models were implemented to accurately predict the synergistic effect of AMPs and antimicrobial agents. The results demonstrated that the hyperparameter-optimized Light Gradient Boosted Machine Classifier (oLGBMC) yielded the best test accuracy of 76.92% for predicting the synergistic effect. Besides, the feature importance analysis reveals that the target microbial species, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the AMP and the antimicrobial agents, and the used antimicrobial agent were the most important features for the prediction of synergistic effect, which aligns with recent experimental studies in the literature. Conclusion This study reveals that ML algorithms can predict the synergistic activity of two different antimicrobial agents without the need for complex and time-consuming experimental procedures. The implications support that the ML models may not only reduce the experimental cost but also provide validation of experimental procedures.

        "title": "Teleconsultations between Patients and Healthcare Professionals in Primary Care in Catalonia: The Evaluation of Text Classification Algorithms Using Supervised Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Background: The primary care service in Catalonia has operated an asynchronous teleconsulting service between GPs and patients since 2015 (eConsulta), which has generated some 500,000 messages. New developments in big data analysis tools, particularly those involving natural language, can be used to accurately and systematically evaluate the impact of the service. Objective: The study was intended to assess the predictive potential of eConsulta messages through different combinations of vector representation of text and machine learning algorithms and to evaluate their performance. Methodology: Twenty machine learning algorithms (based on five types of algorithms and four text representation techniques) were trained using a sample of 3559 messages (169,102 words) corresponding to 2268 teleconsultations (1.57 messages per teleconsultation) in order to predict the three variables of interest (avoiding the need for a face-to-face visit, increased demand and type of use of the teleconsultation). The performance of the various combinations was measured in terms of precision, sensitivity, F-value and the ROC curve. Results: The best-trained algorithms are generally effective, proving themselves to be more robust when approximating the two binary variables “avoiding the need of a face-to-face visit” and “increased demand” (precision = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively) rather than the variable “type of query” (precision = 0.48). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate a machine learning strategy for text classification using primary care teleconsultation datasets. The study illustrates the possible capacities of text analysis using artificial intelligence. The development of a robust text classification tool could be feasible by validating it with more data, making it potentially more useful for decision support for health professionals.",

        "title": "Advancements in Machine Learning Algorithms for Predictive Analytics in Healthcare",
        "abstract": "Recent improvements in machine learning (ML) algorithms have changed predictive analytics in healthcare in a way that has never been seen before. This means that there are now more ways than ever to improve patient results and business efficiency. This summary looks at important changes and what they mean. A lot of healthcare data, like electronic health records (EHRs), medical images, genetics, and personal sensor data, is being used more and more with machine learning methods like guided learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. These methods make it possible to use predictive models to diagnose diseases, give patients specific treatment suggestions, and keep track of their care. For sorting things into groups, supervised learning techniques like support vector machines (SVM) and random forests have been used to correctly spot diseases based on complicated data trends. For example, SVMs have been useful for telling the difference between different types of cancer from genetic data, which helps with focused treatments. On the other hand, unsupervised learning algorithms like grouping algorithms help find groups of patients who share similar traits, which makes personalized medicine possible. Deep learning, has been very successful in medical picture analysis, being more accurate than humans at tasks like finding tumors in x-rays and lab slides. Its ability to instantly learn traits from raw data has made diagnosis easier and more accurate. ML algorithms also help healthcare operations run more smoothly by using prediction analytics to help hospitals handle their resources better, make the best use of their staff, predict which patients will need to be admitted, and lower the number of times they have to be readmitted. These predictive models use a variety of data sources to guess how patients will do and how they will use healthcare resources, which helps people make smart decisions and make the best use of their resources.",

        "title": "Supervised Machine Learning-Based Models for Predicting Raised Blood Sugar",
        "abstract": "Raised blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is considered a strong indicator of prediabetes or diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common non-communicable diseases (NCDs) affecting the adult population. Recently, the prevalence of diabetes has been increasing at a faster rate, especially in developing countries. The primary concern associated with diabetes is the potential for serious health complications to occur if it is not diagnosed early. Therefore, timely detection and screening of diabetes is considered a crucial factor in treating and controlling the disease. Population screening for raised blood sugar aims to identify individuals at risk before symptoms appear, enabling timely intervention and potentially improved health outcomes. However, implementing large-scale screening programs can be expensive, requiring testing, follow-up, and management resources, potentially straining healthcare systems. Given the above facts, this paper presents supervised machine-learning models to detect and predict raised blood sugar. The proposed raised blood sugar models utilize diabetes-related risk factors including age, body mass index (BMI), eating habits, physical activity, prevalence of other diseases, and fasting blood sugar obtained from the dataset of the STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor study collected from adults in the Palestinian community. The diabetes risk factor obtained from the STEPS dataset was used as input for building the prediction model that was trained using various types of supervised learning classification algorithms including random forest, decision tree, Adaboost, XGBoost, bagging decision trees, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Based on the experimental results, the raised blood sugar models demonstrated optimal performance when implemented with a random forest classifier, yielding an accuracy of 98.4%. Followed by the bagging decision trees, XGBoost, MLP, AdaBoost, and decision tree with an accuracy of 97.4%, 96.4%, 96.3%, 95.2%, and 94.8%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease has emerged as a very critical and intricate condition on a global scale. Healthcare practitioners have long faced substantial challenges in predicting and identifying heart disease. Medical and other healthcare facilities provide costly treatments and surgical procedures for cardiovascular conditions. People throughout the globe would benefit from early heart disease prediction since it would allow them to take action before the issue worsens. These days, heart disease is a major concern, and the primary causes of this illness include things like smoking, excessive alcohol use, and not getting enough exercise. Based on the extensive dataset that the healthcare industry has produced over time, machine learning has proven effective in decisions and forecasts. Logistic regression, Decision- Trees, Naive-Bayes, Random-Forest, and SVM are among the supervised machine learning algorithms that may anticipate the occurrence of heart illness. A synopsis of the algorithm’s performance assessment is also included. A comparison of five models showed that the Decision Tree and Random Forest models were better at predicting heart disease than the others. Also, these models were very accurate, with a 98.5% success rate.",

        "title": "Enhancing Healthcare Data Classification: Leveraging Machine Learning on ChatGPT-Generated Datasets",
        "abstract": "With the large-scale language methods namely ChatGPT, there is a chance to explore the use of machine learning (ML) methods on ChatGPT-generated data for classifying healthcare data. Healthcare data classification gains more significance in extracting and organizing useful insights from the huge volume of medical data available. The ChatGPT-generated data has realistic and different healthcare-based text datasets that can be applied to training classification methods. ML approaches include supervised learning methods as support vector machines (SVMs), and random forests (RF), which can be implemented for classifying the healthcare data. The methods were trained on the ChatGPT-generated data that can be carefully validated and labelled with suitable classes related to the healthcare field. With this motivation, this article presents an automated healthcare data classification-using barnacles mating optimizer with a pyramid neural network (AHDC-BMOPNN) technique. The presented AHDC-BMOPNN technique examines the healthcare data effectually using an ML model with a feature selection process. Primarily, the AHDC-BMOPNN technique exploits min-max data normalization for scaling the input dataset. In addition, the butterfly optimization algorithm-based feature selection (BOA-FS) method is deployed for the selection of optimum feature subset. In this work, the PNN algorithm was utilized for the classification of medical data. Ultimately, the BMO-based hyperparameter tuning process takes place to boost the overall classifier results of the PNN technique. The empirical findings of the AHDC-BMOPNN approach was validated on ChatGPT generated dataset. The simulation values highlight that the AHDC-BMOPNN method and the diverse healthcare text data generated by ChatGPT enhance the ability to extract valuable insights and organize medical information effectively.",

        "abstract": "Classification techniques have become increasingly important in healthcare due to the need for accurate and efficient disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care. Supervised learning algorithms, such as decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, are used for disease diagnosis, predicting patient outcomes, and identifying potential risk factors. Classification techniques are also used in image recognition and analysis, such as in radiology and pathology. Classification is a supervised learning technique used to predict the class or category of an instance based on the given set of attributes. This research study explores the use of classification techniques in data mining for healthcare applications. The goal of this study is to apply classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forest to healthcare datasets and evaluate their performance. The datasets used in this study include patient information such as demographics, medical history, and diagnosis. The findings suggest that the classification techniques can be effective in data mining for healthcare applications, enabling healthcare professionals to make more informed decisions based on patient data.",

        "abstract": "The use of non-invasive tools in conjunction with artificial intelligence (AI) to detect diseases has the potential to revolutionize healthcare. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) is a technology that can be used to analyze biological samples in a non-invasive manner. This study evaluated the use of NIR spectroscopy in the fingertip to detect neutropenia in solid-tumor oncologic patients. A total of 75 patients were enrolled in the study. Fingertip NIR spectra and complete blood counts were collected from each patient. The NIR spectra were pre-processed using Savitzky–Golay smoothing and outlier detection. The pre-processed data were split into training/validation and test sets using the Kennard–Stone method. A toolbox of supervised machine learning classification algorithms was applied to the training/validation set using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation regimen. The algorithms included linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM model performed best in the validation step, with 85% sensitivity, 89% negative predictive value (NPV), and 64% accuracy. The SVM model showed 67% sensitivity, 82% NPV, and 57% accuracy on the test set. These results suggest that NIR spectroscopy in the fingertip, combined with machine learning methods, can be used to detect neutropenia in solid-tumor oncology patients in a non-invasive and timely manner. This approach could help reduce exposure to invasive tests and prevent neutropenic patients from inadvertently undergoing chemotherapy.",

        "title": "Text Mining Data Based Summarization of Novel Approach for Covid-19 with the Use of Machine Learning Techniques",
        "abstract": "At the start of the year 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially recognized COVID-19 as a novel pandemic and subsequently released a corresponding declaration. The aforementioned lethal virus had the capacity to disseminate and proliferate across many countries worldwide. Throughout the duration of the pandemic, social media platforms like as Twitter played a pivotal role in generating considerable amounts of data that contributed to enhancing the efficacy of healthcare-related decision-making processes. Consequently, we propose that the viewpoint articulated by users might be examined by using effective Supervised Machine Learning (SML) algorithms for the purpose of predicting the onset of ailments and providing timely alerts. This study presents a text mining classifier that use machine learning approaches to create summary text. Upon gathering the tweets, we proceeded to prepare them for preprocessing and assign class labels to each instance, including categories such as right, wrong, and neutral, among others. During the second step, a variety of commonly used techniques, including TF-IDF, co-relational analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and relational dependency analysis, are utilized to extract many features from the text. These features are then used to construct the feature vector. For the classification module, we used a binary classification method together with five machine learning algorithms to assess the effectiveness of the suggested model. The NLP-SVM model has a classification accuracy of 95.10%, while the TFIDF-SVM model achieves a classification accuracy of 93.50%. This finding provides evidence that the suggested model is efficacious in the categorization of extensive textual data pertaining to COVID-19, namely on twitter data.",

        "title": "The use of Machine Learning in Predicting Disease Progression",
        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in the healthcare sector, especially in predicting disease progression. This paper examines the application of various ML algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, in predicting disease trajectories, particularly in complex and chronic diseases like Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. By leveraging clinical data, genetic information, and patient history, ML models like random forests and neural networks can accurately predict the time to disease progression. This has profound implications for early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and patient management. However, the integration of these models into clinical practice faces challenges related to data quality, interpretability, and deployment in real-world settings. Despite these limitations, the case studies reviewed demonstrate the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing decision-making processes in healthcare.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Supervised machine learning (SML)-based methods could facilitate early prediction of healthcare-related adverse events. The role of SML in stratifying patient-risk of infectious events during hospitalization and their performance using limited subsets of standardized and widely available predictors is less known. Using a large cohort of adult inpatients, we use SML techniques to predict a diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) during hospitalization. Methods We used previously validated data from adults (≥18 years old) hospitalized between 2009 and 2016 in a healthcare system as part of a federally funded study. The outcome was a UTI detected >2 days after admission. Predictors measured clinical complexity, history of healthcare-associated complications and specific risk factors for UTI. Predictors were restricted to those standardized and readily obtainable across facilities (e.g., ICD codes). Two SML methods, neural networks (NN) and decision trees (DT) were used. The NN used two hidden layers and a sigmoid output function. The DT used binary recursive portioning and Gini coefficient to measure node impurity. 60% of available hospitalizations were the training set, and 40% used as test set for validation. Cross validation was used to refine the model. Oversampling was used to adjust for the rare outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) for the test set measured model performance. Results From a total of 897,344 hospitalizations there were 16,069 UTIs identified from the data set during the study period. Applying NN and DT to the raw dataset, AUC’s of 0.55 and 0.69 were achieved respectively with the test set. Model performance for DNN and DT improved with oversampling to 0.77 and 0.78, outperforming traditional logistic regression (Figure 1). The optimal DT is presented (Figure 2). Conclusion Reasonable prediction performance for an infectious event during hospitalization was achieved using a limited set of routinely available and standardized variables. While both SML methods had comparable performance, the DT was more interpretable. Further work will extend these methods to other infectious events, use more specific EHR data and link these predictions to interventions in real time.

        "abstract": "ADHD is a prevalent disorder among the younger population. Standard evaluation techniques currently use evaluation forms, interviews with the patient, and more. However, its symptoms are similar to those of many other disorders like depression, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder, and these current diagnosis techniques are not very effective. Thus, a sophisticated computing model holds the potential to provide a promising diagnosis solution to this problem. This work attempts to explore methods to diagnose ADHD using combinations of multiple established machine learning techniques like neural networks and SVM models on the ADHD200 dataset and explore the field of neuroscience. In this work, multiclass classification is performed on phenotypic data using an SVM model. The better results have been analyzed on the phenotypic data compared to other supervised learning techniques like Logistic regression, KNN, AdaBoost, etc. In addition, neural networks have been implemented on functional connectivity from the MRI data of a sample of 40 subjects provided to achieve high accuracy without prior knowledge of neuroscience. It is combined with the phenotypic classifier using the ensemble technique to get a binary classifier. It is further trained and tested on 400 out of 824 subjects from the ADHD200 data set and achieved an accuracy of 92.5% for binary classification The training and testing accuracy has been achieved upto 99% using ensemble classifier.",

The study aims to compare the accuracy of the classical model (utilizes all six dimensions of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)) and novel models (utilize four or five dimensions of NASA-TLX) in predicting HCPs' objective performance. We use a dataset from our previous human factors research studies and apply a broad selection of supervised machine learning classification techniques to develop data-driven computational models and predict objective performance. The study findings confirm that classical models are better predictors of objective performance than novel models. This has practical implications for research in health informatics, human factors and ergonomics, and human-computer interaction in healthcare. Findings, although promising, cannot be generalized as they are based on a small dataset. Future studies may investigate additional subjective and physiological measures of CWL to predict HCPs' objective performance.",

        "title": "Privacy Protection of Healthcare Data over Social Networks Using Machine Learning Algorithms",
        "abstract": "With the rapid development of mobile medical care, medical institutions also have the hidden danger of privacy leakage while sharing personal medical data. Based on the k-anonymity and l-diversity supervised models, it is proposed to use the classified personalized entropy l-diversity privacy protection model to protect user privacy in a fine-grained manner. By distinguishing solid and weak sensitive attribute values, the constraints on sensitive attributes are improved, and the sensitive information is reduced for the leakage probability of vital information to achieve the safety of medical data sharing. This research offers a customized information entropy l-diversity model and performs experiments to tackle the issues that the information entropy l-diversity model does not discriminate between strong and weak sensitive features. Data analysis and experimental results show that this method can minimize execution time while improving data accuracy and service quality, which is more effective than existing solutions. The limits of solid and weak on sensitive qualities are enhanced, sensitive data are reduced, and the chance of crucial data leakage is lowered, all of which contribute to the security of healthcare data exchange. This research offers a customized information entropy l-diversity model and performs experiments to tackle the issues that the information entropy l-diversity model does not discriminate between strong and weak sensitive features. The scope of this research is that this paper enhances data accuracy while minimizing the algorithm's execution time.",

        "abstract": "In an increasingly data-driven world, artificial intelligence is expected to be a key tool for converting big data into tangible benefits and the healthcare domain is no exception to this. Machine learning aims to identify complex patterns in multi-dimensional data and use these uncovered patterns to classify new unseen cases or make data-driven predictions. In recent years, deep neural networks have shown to be capable of producing results that considerably exceed those of conventional machine learning methods for various classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we provide an accessible tutorial of the most important supervised machine learning concepts and methods, including deep learning, which are potentially the most relevant for the medical domain. We aim to take some of the mystery out of machine learning and depict how machine learning models can be useful for medical applications. Finally, this tutorial provides a few practical suggestions for how to properly design a machine learning model for a generic medical problem.",

        "abstract": "Smart information systems are based on sensors that generate a huge amount of data. This data can be stored in cloud for further processing and efficient utilization. Anomalous data might be present within the sensor data due to various reasons (e.g., malicious activities by intruders, low quality sensors, and node deployment in harsh environments). Anomaly detection is crucial in some applications such as healthcare monitoring systems, forest fire information systems, and other internet of things (IoT) systems. This paper proposes a Gaussian distribution-based supervised machine learning scheme of anomaly detection (GDA) for healthcare monitoring sensor cloud, which is an integration of various body sensors of different patients and cloud. This work is implemented in Python. Use of Gaussian statistical model in the proposed scheme improves precision, throughput, and efficiency. GDA provides 98% efficiency with 3% and 4% improvements as compared to the other supervised learning-based anomaly detection schemes (e.g., support vector machine [SVM] and self-organizing map [SOM], respectively).",

In the healthcare sector, data analysis is a widely utilized method for processing massive amounts of data. Researchers use a variety of statistical and machine learning methods to evaluate massive amounts of complicated medical data, assisting healthcare practitioners in predicting cardiac disease. This study covers many aspects of cardiac illness, as well as a model based on supervised learning techniques such as Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Logistic Regression (LR). It makes use of an existing dataset from the UCI Cleveland database of heart disease patients. There are 303 occurrences and 76 characteristics in the collection. Only 14 of these 76 characteristics are evaluated for testing, which is necessary to validate the performance of various methods. The purpose of this study is to forecast the likelihood of individuals getting heart disease. The findings show that logistic regression achieves the best accuracy score (92.10%).",

        "abstract": "Introduction Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that significantly impacts the mental, emotional, and social development of children. Early screening for ASD typically involves the use of a series of questionnaires. With answers to these questionnaires, healthcare professionals can identify whether a child is at risk for developing ASD and refer them for further evaluation and diagnosis. CHAT-23 is an effective and widely used screening test in China for the early screening of ASD, which contains 23 different kinds of questions. Methods We have collected clinical data from Wuxi, China. All the questions of CHAT-23 are regarded as different kinds of features for building machine learning models. We introduce machine learning methods into ASD screening, using the Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) feature selection method to analyze the most important questions among all 23 from the collected CHAT-23 questionnaires. Seven mainstream supervised machine learning models were built and experiments were conducted. Results Among the seven supervised machine learning models evaluated, the best-performing model achieved a sensitivity of 0.909 and a specificity of 0.922 when the number of features was reduced to 9. This demonstrates the model's ability to accurately identify children for ASD with high precision, even with a more concise set of features. Discussion Our study focuses on the health of Chinese children, introducing machine learning methods to provide more accurate and effective early screening tests for autism. This approach not only enhances the early detection of ASD but also helps in refining the CHAT-23 questionnaire by identifying the most relevant questions for the diagnosis process.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a sluggish and cumulative decline of kidney characteristics over the years. Early detection of CKD is essential when you consider that delayed detection and hospital treatment of the situation might eventually bring about the final stage of CKD and the patient’s death. The prediction of diseases has grown to be appreciably impacted by means of the utilization of machine learning (ML) in healthcare. Thus, ML methods are the simplest in CKD prediction. The major goal is to use distinct supervised ML techniques, such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Logistic Regression, to examine and verify how correct they may be at detecting CKD. The proposed model provides various strategies for detecting CKD using medical facts which incorporates data preprocessing, strategies for handling missing values, and data reduction. It is noted that the clinical data has been classified with an overall accuracy of $100 \\%$ by the Random Forest algorithm. The suggested ML model will help doctors identify chronic kidney ailments early on, which will be an effective manner of preventing the illness.",

        "title": "Exploring supervised machine learning approaches to predicting Veterans Health Administration chiropractic service utilization",
        "abstract": "Background Chronic spinal pain conditions affect millions of US adults and carry a high healthcare cost burden, both direct and indirect. Conservative interventions for spinal pain conditions, including chiropractic care, have been associated with lower healthcare costs and improvements in pain status in different clinical populations, including veterans. Little is currently known about predicting healthcare service utilization in the domain of conservative interventions for spinal pain conditions, including the frequency of use of chiropractic services. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to explore the use of supervised machine learning approaches to predicting one-year chiropractic service utilization by veterans receiving VA chiropractic care. Methods We included 19,946 veterans who entered the Musculoskeletal Diagnosis Cohort between October 1, 2003 and September 30, 2013 and utilized VA chiropractic services within one year of cohort entry. The primary outcome was one-year chiropractic service utilization following index chiropractic visit, split into quartiles represented by the following classes: 1 visit, 2 to 3 visits, 4 to 6 visits, and 7 or greater visits. We compared the performance of four multiclass classification algorithms (gradient boosted classifier, stochastic gradient descent classifier, support vector classifier, and artificial neural network) in predicting visit quartile using 158 sociodemographic and clinical features. Results The selected algorithms demonstrated poor prediction capabilities. Subset accuracy was 42.1% for the gradient boosted classifier, 38.6% for the stochastic gradient descent classifier, 41.4% for the support vector classifier, and 40.3% for the artificial neural network. The micro-averaged area under the precision-recall curve for each one-versus-rest classifier was 0.43 for the gradient boosted classifier, 0.38 for the stochastic gradient descent classifier, 0.43 for the support vector classifier, and 0.42 for the artificial neural network. Performance of each model yielded only a small positive shift in prediction probability (approximately 15%) compared to naïve classification. Conclusions Using supervised machine learning to predict chiropractic service utilization remains challenging, with only a small shift in predictive probability over naïve classification and limited clinical utility. Future work should examine mechanisms to improve model performance.",

The discovery of such essential data helps researchers gain valuable insight into how to utilize their diagnosis and treatment for a particular patient. Researchers use various Machine Learning methods to examine massive amounts of complex healthcare data, which aids healthcare professionals in predicting diseases. In this research, we are using an online UCI dataset with 303 rows and 76 properties. Approximately 14 of these 76 properties are selected for testing, which is necessary to validate the performances of different methods. The isolation forest approach uses the data set’s most essential qualities and metrics to standardize the information for better precision. This analysis is based on supervised learning methods, i.e., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, and K- Nearest Neighbor. The experimental results demonstrate the strength of KNN with eight neighbours order to test the effectiveness, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy, F1-score; as compared to other methods, i.e., Naive Bayes, SVM (Linear Kernel), Decision Tree Classifier with 4 or 18 features, and Random Forest classifiers.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, healthcare data analysis is becoming one of the most promising research areas. Healthcare includes data in various types such as clinical data, Omics data, and Sensor data. Clinical data includes electronic health records which store patient records collected during ongoing treatment. Omics data is one of the high dimensional data comprising genome, transcriptome and proteome data types. Sensor data is collected from various wearable and wireless sensor devices. To handle this raw data manually is very difficult. For analysis of data, machine learning is emerged as a significant tool. Machine learning uses various statistical techniques and advanced algorithms to predict the results of healthcare data more precisely. In machine learning different types of algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement are used for analysis. In this paper, different types of machine learning algorithms are described. Then use of machine learning algorithms for analyzing various healthcare data are surveyed.",

        "abstract": "Liver failure is a serious medical condition that can have life-threatening consequences. The liver is responsible for filtering blood and performing many other important functions. With the rise of machine learning in healthcare, there is an opportunity to use past datasets to predict liver failure early on. The main focus of this research work is to explore the application of supervised machine learning algorithms in predicting liver failure. The study involved pre-processing techniques such as univariate and bivariate analysis, and data visualization to gain better insights into the features of the dataset. Using these techniques, a multi-class classification model was built with machine learning algorithms, and the performance metrics of accuracy, F1 score, and recall were used to compare the algorithms. The results show that machine learning algorithms can accurately predict liver failure and can be an effective tool in healthcare. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting liver failure and can contribute to the development of future models in the field. The results of this research study indicates that the proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 94.48%. The proposed work will be beneficial to researchers in this field and inspire them to build more advanced and accurate models.",

        "title": "Machine Learning Algorithms, Perspectives, and Real - World Application: Empirical Evidence from United States Trade Data",
        "abstract": ": Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without being explicitly programmed. It is one of today’s most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the crossroads of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi - supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in this area. Recent progress in ML has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms theory, and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of vast amount of data (commonly known as “big - data”) and low - cost computation. The adoption of data - intensive ML - based methods can be found throughout science, technology, and commerce, leading to more evidence - based decision - making across many walks of life, including finance, manufacturing, international trade, economics, education, healthcare, marketing, policymaking, and data governance. The present paper provides a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. Moreover, the paper attempts to determine the accurate clusters of similar industries in United States that collectively account for more than 85 percent of economy’s aggregate export and import flows over the period 2002 - 2021 through clustering algorithm (unsupervised learning). Four clusters of mapping labels have been used, namely the low investment (LL), category 1 medium investment (HL), category 2 medium investment (LH) and high investment (HH). The empirical results indicate that machinery and electrical equipment is classified as a high investment sector due to its efficient production mechanism. The analysis further underlines the need for upstream value chain integration through skill - augmentation and innovation especially in low investment industries. Overall, this paper aims to explain the trends of ML approaches and their applicability in various real - world domains, as well as serve as a reference point for academia",

        "abstract": "Mobile apps for healthcare (mHealth apps for short) have been increasingly adapted to help users manage their health or to get healthcare services. User feedback analysis is a pertinent method that can be used to improve the quality of mHealth apps. The objective of this paper is to use supervised machine learning algorithms to evaluate the quality of mHealth apps according to the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model based on user feedback. For this purpose, a total of 1682 user reviews have been collected from 86 mHealth apps provided by Google Play Store. Those reviews have been classified initially into the ISO/IEC 25010 eight quality characteristics, and further into Negative, Positive, and Neutral opinions. This analysis has been performed using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The best performances were provided by the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier with an accuracy of 82.00% in classifying user reviews according to the ISO/IEC 25010 quality characteristics. Moreover, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classified the collected user reviews into Negative, Positive, and Neutral with an accuracy of 90.50%. Finally, for each quality characteristic, we classified the collected reviews according to the sentiment polarity. The best performance results were obtained for the Usability, Security, and Compatibility quality characteristics using SGD classifier with an accuracy equal to 98.00%, 97.50%, and 96.00%, respectively. The results of this paper will be effective to assist developers in improving the quality of mHealth apps.",

        "title": "Predicting Patient Sexual Function After Prostate Surgery Using Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "A major health concern for men is prostate cancer. An accurate prediction of patients' conditions after surgery is essential for understanding their quality of life. For improving patient care, medical and healthcare professionals use machine learning for a variety of purposes. By using supervised machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify the most reliable predictors of patient sexual function one year after surgery. We used the EPIC-26 (Expanded Prostate Index Composite-26) questionnaire to assess the patient's quality of life and sexual function. An approximate 500 patient sample was used in our case study to test the effectiveness of this methodology. Based on demographic and clinical data collected prior to surgery, our model predicts patient self-assessment of sexual function with high accuracy one year after surgery. In order to improve and enhance the quality of the patient experience, the methodology presented can support clinical decisions.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an e-diagnosis system based on machine learning (ML) algorithms to be implemented on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environment, particularly for diagnosing diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes). However, the ML applications tend to be mistrusted because of their inability to show the internal decision-making process, resulting in slow uptake by end-users within certain healthcare sectors. This research delineates the use of three interpretable supervised ML models: Naïve Bayes classifier, random forest classifier, and J48 decision tree models to be trained and tested using the Pima Indians diabetes dataset in R programming language. The performance of each algorithm is analyzed to determine the one with the best accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. An assessment of the decision process is also made to improve the model. It can be concluded that a Naïve Bayes model works well with a more fine-tuned selection of features for binary classification, while random forest works better with more features.",

        "title": "Use of artificial intelligence for public health surveillance: a case study to develop a machine Learning-algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes mellitus in France",
        "abstract": "Background The use of machine learning techniques is increasing in healthcare which allows to estimate and predict health outcomes from large administrative data sets more efficiently. The main objective of this study was to develop a generic machine learning (ML) algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes based on the number of reimbursements over the last 2 years. Methods We selected a final data set from a population-based epidemiological cohort (i.e., CONSTANCES) linked with French National Health Database (i.e., SNDS). To develop this algorithm, we adopted a supervised ML approach. Following steps were performed: i. selection of final data set, ii. target definition, iii. Coding variables for a given window of time, iv. split final data into training and test data sets, v. variables selection, vi. training model, vii. Validation of model with test data set and viii. Selection of the model. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to select the best algorithm. Results The final data set used to develop the algorithm included 44,659 participants from CONSTANCES. Out of 3468 variables from SNDS linked to CONSTANCES cohort were coded, 23 variables were selected to train different algorithms. The final algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes was a Linear Discriminant Analysis model based on number of reimbursements of selected variables related to biological tests, drugs, medical acts and hospitalization without a procedure over the last 2 years. This algorithm has a sensitivity of 62%, a specificity of 67% and an accuracy of 67% [95% CI: 0.66–0.68]. Conclusions Supervised ML is an innovative tool for the development of new methods to exploit large health administrative databases. In context of InfAct project, we have developed and applied the first time a generic ML-algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes for public health surveillance. The ML-algorithm we have developed, has a moderate performance. The next step is to apply this algorithm on SNDS to estimate the incidence of type 2 diabetes cases. More research is needed to apply various MLTs to estimate the incidence of various health conditions.",

        "abstract": "One of the most promising fields in medicine is the application of artificial intelligence methods to medical imaging. Though annotating medical images is an expensive operation, most of the recent success in this field has relied heavily on vast amounts of meticulously annotated data. The best that we can tell, the method we present in this research, hybrid approach, is the first to use recent developments in semi-supervised learning (SSL) for medical imaging recognition. Due to the growing complexity of healthcare data, machine learning techniques like Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have become more and more popular. Machine learning (ML) techniques can uncover hidden patterns and other important facts from the massive amount of health data that traditional analytics can’t find in a reasonable length of time. These advancements will have a significant impact on medical imaging technology, medical healthcare data processing, medical illness diagnostics, and general healthcare. We have two goals: First to conduct a survey on DL techniques to medical pictures; and second proposed hybrid DL-based approaches for image classification. This paper mainly proposed hybrid methodology for medical imaging which can improve semi supervised model.",

        "title": "­Use of Artificial Intelligence for Public Health Surveillance: A case study to develop a Machine Learning-algorithm to estimate the incidence of Diabetes Mellitus in France",
        "abstract": "\n Background The use of machine learning techniques is increasing in healthcare which allows to estimate and predict health outcomes from large administrative data sets more efficiently. The main objective of this study was to develop a generic machine learning (ML) algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes based on the number of reimbursements over the last 2 years. Methods We selected a training data set from a population-based epidemiological cohort (i.e., CONSTANCES) linked with French National Health Database (i.e., SNDS) to develop a ML-algorithm for estimating the incidence of diabetes. To develop this algorithm, we adopted a supervised ML approach. Following steps were performed: i. selection of final data set, ii. target definition, iii. coding variables for a given window of time, iv. split final data into training and test data sets, v. variables selection, vi. training model, vii. validation of model with test data set and viii. selection of the model. Results The final data set used to develop the algorithm included 44,659 participants from CONSTANCES. Out of 3,468 variables, which were similar in SNDS and CONSTANCES cohort were coded, 23 variables were selected to train different algorithms. The final algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes was a Linear Discriminant Analysis model based on number of reimbursements of selected variables related to biological tests, drugs, medical acts and hospitalization without a procedure over the last two years. This algorithm has a sensitivity of 62%, a specificity of 67% and an accuracy of 67% [95% CI: 0.66 – 0.68]. Conclusions Supervised ML is an innovative tool for the development of new methods to exploit large health administrative databases. In context of InfAct project, we have developed and applied the first time a generic ML-algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes for public health surveillance. The ML-algorithm we have developed, has a moderate performance. The next step is to apply this algorithm on SNDS to estimate the incidence of type 2 diabetes cases. More research is needed to apply various MLTs to estimate the incidence of various health conditions and to calculate the contribution of various risk factors on developing type 2 diabetes.",

        "title": "Improving Prostate Cancer Diagnosis with Weakly Supervised Learning and Radiology-Confirmed Negative MRI Data",
        "abstract": "This work demonstrates the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and proposes a fresh approach to prostate cancer diagnosis through the application of machine learning models. The research makes use of a dataset of 2498 prostate pictures, of which 40% show benign diseases and 60% show cancerous ones. Many machine learning models are trained using comprehensive feature extraction, with an emphasis on texture- and intensity-based variables. With accuracy of 95.8%, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 96.2%, 95.5%, and 95.8%, respectively, CNN performs remarkably well. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) all show great accuracy with scores of 92.2%, 88.7%, and 86.5%, respectively. A thorough examination can result in more advantages and suitability of various models for prostate cancer screening. CNN is a suitable option for workflow integration in the healthcare industry because of its improved performance metrics and interpretability. With its ability to make better decisions, the accuracy of diagnoses and patient outcomes are improved and also these machine learning models have the potential to fundamentally alter the way prostate cancer is treated. This research shows how computational techniques could revolutionize the way prostate cancer is now identified and open up the opportunity to more accurate and individualized treatment plans.",

        "title": "Detecting drug diversion in health-system data using machine learning and advanced analytics",
        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The theft of drugs from healthcare facilities, also known as drug diversion, occurs frequently but is often undetected. This paper describes a research study to develop and test novel drug diversion detection methods. Improved diversion detection and reduction in diversion improves patient safety, limits harm to the person diverting, reduces the public health impact of substance use disorder, and mitigates significant liability risk to pharmacists and their organizations. Methods Ten acute care inpatient hospitals across 4 independent health systems extracted 2 datasets from various health information technology systems. Both datasets were consolidated, normalized, classified, and sampled to provide a harmonious dataset for analysis. Supervised machine learning methods were iteratively used on the initial sample dataset to train algorithms to classify medication movement transactions as involving a low or high risk of diversion. Thereafter, the resulting machine learning model classified the risk of diversion in a historical dataset capturing 8 to 24 months of history that included 27.9 million medication movement transactions by 19,037 nursing, 1,047 pharmacy, and 712 anesthesia clinicians and that included 22 known, blinded diversion cases to measure when the model would have detected the diversion compared to when the diversion was actually detected by existing methods. Results The machine learning model had 96.3% accuracy, 95.9% specificity, and 96.6% sensitivity in detecting transactions involving a high risk of diversion using the initial sample dataset. In subsequent testing using the much larger historical dataset, the analytics detected known diversion cases (n = 22) in blinded data faster than existing detection methods (a mean of 160 days and a median of 74 days faster; range, 7-579 days faster). Conclusion The study showed that (1) consolidated datasets and (2) supervised machine learning can detect known diversion cases faster than existing detection methods. Users of the technology also noted improved investigation efficiency.",

        "title": "Pressure Mapping Using Nanocomposite-Enhanced Foam and Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Pressure mapping has garnered considerable interest in the healthcare and robotic industries. Low-cost and large-area compliant devices, as well as fast and effective computational algorithms, have been proposed in the last few years to facilitate distributed pressure sensing. One approach is to use electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to reconstruct the contact pressure distribution of piezoresistive materials. While tremendous success has been demonstrated, conventional algorithms may be unsuitable for real-time monitoring due to its computational demand and runtime. Moreover, the low resolution of reconstructed images is a well-known issue related to the regularization strategies typically employed for traditional EIT methods. Therefore, in this study, two different supervised machine learning (ML) approaches, namely, radial basis function networks and deep neural networks, were employed to efficiently solve the inverse EIT problem and improve the resolution of reconstructed pressure maps. The demonstration of high-resolution pressure mapping, specifically, for identifying pressure hotspots, was achieved using a carbon nanotube-based thin film integrated with foam.",

The use of salivary components to monitor and detect kidney disease is investigated through an experimental investigation. We measured the amount of urea in the saliva sample to detect CKD. Further, this article explains the use of predictive analysis using machine learning techniques and data analytics in remote healthcare management.

        "abstract": "Objectives Unstructured free-text patient feedback contains rich information, and analysing these data manually would require a lot of personnel resources which are not available in most healthcare organisations.To undertake a systematic review of the literature on the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to process and analyse free-text patient experience data. Methods Databases were systematically searched to identify articles published between January 2000 and December 2019 examining NLP to analyse free-text patient feedback. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the studies, a narrative synthesis was deemed most appropriate. Data related to the study purpose, corpus, methodology, performance metrics and indicators of quality were recorded. Results Nineteen articles were included. The majority (80%) of studies applied language analysis techniques on patient feedback from social media sites (unsolicited) followed by structured surveys (solicited). Supervised learning was frequently used (n=9), followed by unsupervised (n=6) and semisupervised (n=3). Comments extracted from social media were analysed using an unsupervised approach, and free-text comments held within structured surveys were analysed using a supervised approach. Reported performance metrics included the precision, recall and F-measure, with support vector machine and Naïve Bayes being the best performing ML classifiers. Conclusion NLP and ML have emerged as an important tool for processing unstructured free text. Both supervised and unsupervised approaches have their role depending on the data source. With the advancement of data analysis tools, these techniques may be useful to healthcare organisations to generate insight from the volumes of unstructured free-text data.",

For this purpose, we present a novel mathematical framework. We then conduct a comparative study between established classification methods for the case where the relationship between the text and the corresponding label is clearly depicted by specific words in the text. In particular, we use logistic LASSO, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and decision-tree-like procedures. This methodology is applied to a real case study involving mapping Consolidated Framework for Implementation and Research (CFIR) constructs to health-related text data and achieves a prediction success rate of over 80% when just the first 55% of the text, or more, is used for training and the remaining for testing. The results indicate that the methodology can be useful to accelerate the CFIR coding process.",

In the healthcare sector, data can be accessed from various means such as sensor data, Clinical data, and Omics data. Data from various wireless sensor devices and the wearable device are a form of sensor data. Data from the health records that store patient's records during treatment are a form of clinical data. A high dimensional data that contains proteome data types, transcriptome, and Genome are a form of Omics data. Raw data can be very difficult to handle manually, for this reason, the emergence of machine learning proved to be a significant tool for data analysis. The prediction and precision of healthcare data accurately are now more visible because of the various statistical techniques and advanced algorithms that machine learning employs. There are different types of algorithms in machine learning such as the hybrid model, reinforced learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning that are utilized for data analysis. In this paper, the description of various types of machine learning algorithms and the analysis of healthcare data are surveyed using the machine learning algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning in the medical area has become a very important requirement. The healthcare professional needs useful tools to diagnose medical illnesses. Classifiers are important to provide tools that can be useful to the health professional for this purpose. However, questions arise: which classifier to use? What metrics are appropriate to measure the performance of the classifier? How to determine a good distribution of the data so that the classifier does not bias the medical patterns to be classified in a particular class? Then most important question: does a classifier perform well for a particular disease? This paper will present some answers to the questions mentioned above, making use of classification algorithms widely used in machine learning research with datasets relating to medical illnesses under the supervised learning scheme. In addition to state-of-the-art algorithms in pattern classification, we introduce a novelty: the use of meta-learning to determine, a priori, which classifier would be the ideal for a specific dataset. The results obtained show numerically and statistically that there are reliable classifiers to suggest medical diagnoses. In addition, we provide some insights about the expected performance of classifiers for such a task.",

        "title": "Applying Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Emotion Recognition Using Physiological Signals",
        "abstract": "The use of machine learning (ML) techniques in affective computing applications focuses on improving the user experience in emotion recognition. The collection of input data (e.g., physiological signals), together with expert annotations are part of the established standard supervised learning methodology used to train human emotion recognition models. However, these models generally require large amounts of labeled data, which is expensive and impractical in the healthcare context, in which data annotation requires even more expert knowledge. To address this problem, this paper explores the use of the self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm in the development of emotion recognition methods. This approach makes it possible to learn representations directly from unlabeled signals and subsequently use them to classify affective states. This paper presents the key concepts of emotions and how SSL methods can be applied to recognize affective states. We experimentally analyze and compare self-supervised and fully supervised training of a convolutional neural network designed to recognize emotions. The experimental results using three emotion datasets demonstrate that self-supervised representations can learn widely useful features that improve data efficiency, are widely transferable, are competitive when compared to their fully supervised counterparts, and do not require the data to be labeled for learning.",

        "title": "Survival Prediction of Heart Failure Patients using Stacked Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithm",
        "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of global death from chronic diseases. Data mining using machine learning (ML) converts massive volumes of raw data created by healthcare institutions into meaningful information that can aid in making predictions and crucial decisions. After an HF, collecting and analyzing follow-up data from patients is critical to monitor their health recovery. The aim of this study is to use ML and predict the survival possibility of patients after HF based on the follow-up data. Three supervised classifiers i.e., Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and Decision Tree (DT) have been used in our study. Moreover, we proposed to design a supervised stacked ensemble learning model that can achieve a prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.98%, 100%, 99.98%, and 99.98%, respectively. The ensemble structure has three base learners (DT, RF & XGB) and one meta learner (RF). The integration of multiple algorithms boosted the prediction performance, which is a significant improvement from the other contemporary studies. Our results demonstrate that Ensemble ML can be a powerful intervention tool to predict accurately, beforehand, the recovery status of a chronic HF patient and prevent potential fatalities.",

        "title": "Machine learning models predicting multidrug resistant urinary tract infections using “DsaaS”",
        "abstract": "The scope of this work is to build a Machine Learning model able to predict patients risk to contract a multidrug resistant urinary tract infection (MDR UTI) after hospitalization. To achieve this goal, we used different popular Machine Learning tools. Moreover, we integrated an easy-to-use cloud platform, called DSaaS (Data Science as a Service), well suited for hospital structures, where healthcare operators might not have specific competences in using programming languages but still, they do need to analyze data as a continuous process. Moreover, DSaaS allows the validation of data analysis models based on supervised Machine Learning regression and classification algorithms. We used DSaaS on a real antibiotic stewardship dataset to make predictions about antibiotic resistance in the Clinical Pathology Operative Unit of the Principe di Piemonte Hospital in Senigallia, Marche, Italy. Data related to a total of 1486 hospitalized patients with nosocomial urinary tract infection (UTI). Sex, age, age class, ward and time period, were used to predict the onset of a MDR UTI. Machine Learning methods such as Catboost, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks were utilized to build predictive models. Among the performance evaluators, already implemented in DSaaS, we used accuracy (ACC), area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), area under Precision-Recall curve (AUC-PRC), F1 score, sensitivity (SEN), specificity and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Catboost exhibited the best predictive results (MCC 0.909; SEN 0.904; F1 score 0.809; AUC-PRC 0.853, AUC-ROC 0.739; ACC 0.717) with the highest value in every metric. the predictive model built with DSaaS may serve as a useful support tool for physicians treating hospitalized patients with a high risk to acquire MDR UTIs. We obtained these results using only five easy and fast predictors accessible for each patient hospitalization. In future, DSaaS will be enriched with more features like unsupervised Machine Learning techniques, streaming data analysis, distributed calculation and big data storage and management to allow researchers to perform a complete data analysis pipeline. The DSaaS prototype is available as a demo at the following address: https://dsaas-demo.shinyapps.io/Server/",

        "abstract": "The increasing availability of electronic health records and administrative data and the adoption of computer-based technologies in healthcare have significantly focused on medical informatics. Sepsis is a time-critical condition with high mortality, yet it is often not identified in a timely fashion. The early detection and diagnosis of sepsis can increase the likelihood of survival and improve long-term outcomes for patients. In this paper, we use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to explore the variables most highly associated with developing sepsis in patients and evaluating different supervised learning models for classification. To develop our predictive models, we used the data collected after the first and the fifth hour of admission and evaluated the contribution of different features to the prediction results for both time intervals. The results of our study show that, while there is a high level of missing data during the early stages of admission, this data can be effectively utilized for the early prediction of sepsis. We also found a high level of inconsistency between the contributing features at different stages of admission, which should be considered when developing machine learning models.",

There is a need for a method of gesture recognition that is as easy to use and ubiquitous as voice recognition is today. In this paper we explore a way to translate from sign language to speech using an innovative method, utilizing the Leap Motion Controller and machine learning algorithms to capture and analyze hand movements in real time, then converting the interpreted signs into spoken word. We seek to build a system that is easy to use, intuitive to understand, adaptable to the individual, and usable in everyday life. This system will be able to work in an adaptive way to learn new signs to expand the dictionary of the system and allow higher accuracy on an individual level. It will have a wide range of applications for healthcare, education, gamification, communication, and more. An optical hand tracking piece of hardware, the Leap Motion Controller will be used to capture hand movements and information to create supervised machine learning models that can be trained to accurately guess American Sign Language (ASL) symbols being signed in real time. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising and provides a high level of accuracy in recognizing ASL.",

        "abstract": "Supervised machine learning algorithms deployed in acute healthcare settings use data describing historical episodes to predict clinical outcomes. Clinical settings are dynamic environments and the underlying data distributions characterising episodes can change with time (a phenomenon known as data drift), and so can the relationship between episode characteristics and associated clinical outcomes (so-called, concept drift). We demonstrate how explainable machine learning can be used to monitor data drift in a predictive model deployed within a hospital emergency department. We use the COVID-19 pandemic as an exemplar cause of data drift, which has brought a severe change in operational circumstances. We present a machine learning classifier trained using (pre-COVID-19) data, to identify patients at high risk of admission to hospital during an emergency department attendance. We evaluate our model's performance on attendances occurring pre-pandemic (AUROC 0.856 95%CI [0.852, 0.859]) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (AUROC 0.826 95%CI [0.814, 0.837]). We demonstrate two benefits of explainable machine learning (SHAP) for models deployed in healthcare settings: (1) By tracking the variation in a feature's SHAP value relative to its global importance, a complimentary measure of data drift is found which highlights the need to retrain a predictive model. (2) By observing the relative changes in feature importance emergent health risks can be identified.",

        "title": "Prediction of Diabetes in Females of Pima Indian Heritage: A Complete Supervised Learning Approach",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, diabetes is a common disease that affects millions of people over the world, and women are mostly affected by this disease. Recent healthcare studies have applied various innovative and advanced technologies to diagnose people and predict their disease based on clinical data. One of such technologies is machine learning (ML) in which diagnosis and prediction can be made more accurately. In this paper, the designed model predicts the diabetes of females of Pima Indians heritage by taking the clinical dataset. Here, this problem is considered as a binary classification problem. Therefore, supervised learning algorithms have been used, such as classification tree (CT), support vector machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), AdaBoost (AB) and Logistic Regression (LR). We use the female Pima Indians diabetic dataset from Kaggle and UCI data repository and k-fold cross-validation to carry out the process of training and testing. We determine the area under the curve (AUC), classification accuracy (CA), F1, precision and recall results of all the supervised learning algorithms and compare them to determine the best algorithm that is suitable for prediction. For this, we use the Orange 3.24.1 open-source platform to generate the results, which uses Python open-source libraries. From the results, it is concluded that the LR performs better in comparison to other algorithms",

        "title": "Tackling the Challenges of Machine Learning for Mobile Health Systems",
        "abstract": "The prominence of mobile devices and recent breakthroughs in machine learning have enabled an emerging class of new mobile health systems which hold the promise of transforming today's reactive healthcare practice to proactive, individualized care and wellbeing. However, the current mainstream machine learning approaches are largely supervised and must be trained by a large amount of labelled high-quality data. In contrast, due to small form factor and limited sensing capability, today's off-the-shelf mobile devices can only collect noisy and sporadic samples from users. Moreover, personal health data collected by on-device sensors cannot be uploaded or shared with other devices due to privacy concerns. These challenges have significantly hindered the performance and utility of mobile health systems in real-world settings. In this talk, I will first discuss new mobile systems that exploit human physiological models and innovative use of sensing modalities to achieve highly robust sensing performance without requiring extensive training. I will describe RunBuddy - the first smartphone-based system for monitoring continuous running rhythm and improving exercise efficiency. To mitigate significant environmental noise during running, RunBuddy integrates novel ambient sensing algorithms and a physiological model called Locomotor Respiratory Coupling (LRC). Based on this result, we also develop BreathCoach, a smart and unobtrusive system using smartwatch and smartphone-based VR for in-home RSA-BT (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia biofeedback-based Breathing Training), which is a common cardiorespiratory intervention to diseases such as asthma and an effective exercise to reduce anxiety. BreathCoach continuously monitors key bio-signals such as breathing pattern and inter-beat interval, and then recommends breathing patterns in the form of an intuitive VR game to provide an immersive training experience. In the second part of this talk, I will discuss a new approach for home activity recognition via federated learning. People spend significant portion of time in home. Characterizing home activities including both individual and family activities is important for studies of health, sociology, and home economics. For instance, risk factors of dementia and childhood obesity are strongly associated with a family's daily activities, and activity logging is proved a very effective approach to improve the self-awareness and motivate people to modify their behaviors toward a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, to date, there has been no unobtrusive and convenient methods to log family activities. I will present several new sensing and federated learning algorithms that enable mobile devices to collaboratively improve the accuracy of home activity sensing without sharing any sensor data, preserving user privacy.",

To fully exploit the information and knowledge, data mining and machine learning methods have been developed and studied. We notice that a large body of healthcare data are lack of supervised information which requires expense human efforts in labelling or scoring them so as to be analysed in a data mining model. In this article, we address the problem of making use of unlabeled or un-scored data, together with only a few supervised data, to improve the performance of analysis model for healthcare decision making. This kind of paradise is called semi-supervised learning in machine learning literatures. We focus on semi-supervised kernel learning and propose to apply the learned kernel in two algorithms, i.e., support vector machine SVM and kernel regularised least squares KRLS. The evaluation results on two publicly available healthcare dataset illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

        "title": "On the identification of thyroid nodules using semi‐supervised deep learning",
        "abstract": "Detecting malign cases from thyroid nodule examinations is crucial in healthcare particularly to improve the early detection of such cases. However, malign thyroid nodules can be extremely rare and is hard to find using the traditional rule based or expert‐based methods. For this reason, the solutions backed by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are key to improve the detection rates of such rare cases. In this paper, we investigate the application of ML in the healthcare domain for the detection of rare thyroid nodules. The utilized dataset is collected from 636 distinct patients in 99 unique days in Turkey. In addition to the texture feature data of the Ultrasound (US), we have also included the scores of different assessment methods created by different health institutions (e.g., Korean, American and European thyroid societies) as additional features. For detection of extremely rare malign cases, we use auto‐encoder based neural network model. Through numerical results, it is shown that the auto‐encoder based model can result in an average Recall score of 0.98 and a Sensitivity score of 1.00 for detecting malign and non‐malign cases from the healthcare dataset outperforming the traditional classification algorithms that are trained after Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) oversampling.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: With increasing availability, the use of healthcare databases as complementary data source for drug safety signal detection has been explored to circumvent the limitations inherent in spontaneous reporting. Areas covered: To review the methods proposed for safety signal detection in healthcare databases and their performance. Expert opinion: Fifteen different data mining methods were identified. They are based on disproportionality analysis, traditional pharmacoepidemiological designs (e.g. self-controlled designs), sequence symmetry analysis (SSA), sequential statistical testing, temporal association rules, supervised machine learning (SML), and the tree-based scan statistic. When considering the performance of these methods, the self-controlled designs, the SSA, and the SML seemed the most interesting approaches. In the perspective of routine signal detection from healthcare databases, pragmatic aspects such as the need for stakeholders to understand the method in order to be confident in the results must be considered. From this point of view, the SSA could appear as the most suitable method for signal detection in healthcare databases owing to its simple principle and its ability to provide a risk estimate. However, further developments, such as automated prioritization, are needed to help stakeholders handle the multiplicity of signals.",

        "abstract": "Data is incredibly significant in today's digital age because data represents facts and numbers from our regular life transactions. Data is no longer arriving in a static form; it is now arriving in a streaming fashion. Data streams are the arrival of limitless, continuous, and rapid data. The healthcare industry is a major generator of data streams. Processing data streams is extremely complex due to factors such as volume, pace, and variety. Data stream classification is difficult owing to idea drift. Concept drift occurs in supervised learning when the statistical properties of the target variable that the model predicts change unexpectedly. We focused on solving various forms of concept drift problems in healthcare data streams in this research, and we outlined the existing statistical and machine learning methodologies for dealing with concept drift. It also emphasizes the use of deep learning algorithms for concept drift detection and describes the various healthcare datasets utilized for concept drift detection in data stream categorization.",

        "abstract": "The rehabilitation process for hip replacement surgery relies on supervised exercises recommended by medical authorities. However, limitations in therapist availability, budget constraints, and evaluation inconsistencies have prompted the need for a more accessible and user-friendly solution. In this paper, we propose a scalable, user-friendly, and cost-effective vision-based human action recognition system utilizing machine learning (ML) and 2D cameras. By providing personalized monitoring, our solution aims to address the limitations of traditional rehabilitation methods and support productive home-based healthcare. A key component of our work involves the use of deep learning (DL) method to align time-series exercise data, which ensures accurate analysis and assessment. Additionally, we introduce the concept of a Golden Feature, which plays a critical role in the framework by providing valuable insights into exercise execution and contributing to overall system accuracy. Furthermore, our framework goes beyond predicting exercise scores and focuses on predicting comments for partially successful cases using a multi-label ML model. This allows for a deeper understanding of the clinical reasons behind partial success, such as the patient's physical condition and their execution of the exercise. By identifying and analyzing these factors, our framework provides meaningful feedback and guidance to support effective rehabilitation. When evaluated on multiple exercises, the system achieved an accuracy level of 80% or higher on predicting execution score, and 72% on predicting the execution feedback.",

        "title": "A careful approach to artificial intelligence: the struggles with epistemic responsibility of healthcare professionals",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Machine learning approaches are being developed to contribute to the treatment of patients and the organisation of care. These new approaches are created in complex environments that include data and computational models as well as new practices, roles and competencies. In such settings, individualised conceptions of agents bearing responsibility need rethinking. In response, we elaborate on the concept of epistemic responsibility based on De la Bellacasa’s work on care (Bellacasa, M.P. de la. (2017). Matters of care: Speculative ethics in more than human worlds. University of Minnesota Press). To better understand these complex environments and the dynamics of responsibility, we use an ethnographic approach and followed Dutch healthcare professionals who learned the basics of (supervised) machine learning, while they pursued a project in their organisations during a four-month-long course. The professionals struggled with different interdependencies and this brought responsibility-in-the-making into relief. Rather than seeing (growing) relations and impure entanglements as standing in the way of responsibility, we show how connections are worthy of inquiry. We argue that connections are essential to knowledge and that producing epistemic responsibility means considering these embedded relations. In contrast to calls for control and clarification of machine learning techniques, and warnings that they create irresponsible black boxes, our care approach shows how responsibility-in-the-making reveals opportunities for ethical reflection and action. Our approach attends to how humans and non-humans are engaged in caring, reveals patterns around kinds of responsibility, and points to opportunities for avoiding neglect and irresponsibility.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is causing fast transformation in healthcare. EHR contains the patient private information and health history in digital form. Hence, EHR data cannot be shared due to privacy concerns to the Machine Learning(ML) research community, through which we can make the healthcare system smarter and provide quality healthcare services to the patients. As a result, synthetic data is utilised as a backup when real-world data (such as EHR data) is unavailable. Synthetic data can be shared without revealing any private information of the patient. This paper focuses on generating synthetic data from the real dataset. As a use case, we have selected Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) dataset (real) and generated three datasets – real, synthetic, and a combination of real + synthetic. To test the accuracy of the synthetic data, we ran six supervised machine learning algorithms on these three datasets with all characteristics and reduced features to see if the patient had CKD or not. Supervised ML algorithms on the three datasets are assessed based on the following performance metrics - Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1-Score. According to the results, XGBoost surpasses with 100 percent accuracy on all three datasets with full features and a 100 percent accuracy on the mix of real and synthetic datasets with feature reduction.",

To combat this issue, researchers have attempted to build Machine Learning (ML) models capable of accurately adjudicating Vital Sign (VS) alerts raised at the bedside of hemodynamically monitored patients as real or artifact. Previous studies have utilized supervised ML techniques that require substantial amounts of hand-labeled data. However, manually harvesting such data can be costly, time-consuming, and mundane, and is a key factor limiting the widespread adoption of ML in healthcare (HC). Instead, we explore the use of multiple, individually imperfect heuristics to automatically assign probabilistic labels to unlabeled training data using weak supervision. Our weakly supervised models perform competitively with traditional supervised techniques and require less involvement from domain experts, demonstrating their use as efficient and practical alternatives to supervised learning in HC applications of ML.",

        "abstract": "Deployment of machine learning models in real high-risk settings (e.g. healthcare) often depends not only on the model's accuracy but also on its fairness, robustness, and interpretability. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are a class of interpretable models with a long history of use in these high-risk domains, but they lack desirable features of deep learning such as differentiability and scalability. In this work, we propose a neural GAM (NODE-GAM) and neural GA$^2$M (NODE-GA$^2$M) that scale well and perform better than other GAMs on large datasets, while remaining interpretable compared to other ensemble and deep learning models. We demonstrate that our models find interesting patterns in the data. Lastly, we show that we improve model accuracy via self-supervised pre-training, an improvement that is not possible for non-differentiable GAMs.",

Classical approaches to solving tabular problems, such as gradient boosting and random forests, are widely used by practitioners. However, recent deep learning methods have achieved a degree of performance competitive with popular techniques. We devise a hybrid deep learning approach to solving tabular data problems. Our method, SAINT, performs attention over both rows and columns, and it includes an enhanced embedding method. We also study a new contrastive self-supervised pre-training method for use when labels are scarce. SAINT consistently improves performance over previous deep learning methods, and it even outperforms gradient boosting methods, including XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, on average over a variety of benchmark tasks.",

Advances in computing enable the use of supervised machine learning (SML) techniques to predict hospital-onset infections.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe purpose of this study was to trial SML methods to predict urinary tract infections (UTI) during inpatient hospitalization at the time of admission.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIn a large cohort of adult hospitalizations in three New York City acute care facilities (N = 897,344), we used two SML methods-neural networks and decision trees-to predict having a hospital-onset UTI using data available and accessible on the first day of admission at healthcare facilities in the United States.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPerformance for both neural network and decision tree models were superior compared to logistic regression methods. The decision tree model had a higher sensitivity compared to neural network but a lower specificity.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nSML methods show potential for automated accurate UTI risk stratification using electronic data routinely available at admission; this could relieve nurses from the burden of having to complete and document additional risk assessment forms in the electronic medical record. Future studies should pilot and test interventions linked to the risk stratification results, such as short nursing educational modules or alerts triggered for high-risk patients.",

        "title": "Autoencoder-Based Neural Network Model for Anomaly Detection in Wireless Body Area Networks",
        "abstract": "In medical healthcare services, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are enabler tools for tracking healthcare conditions by monitoring some critical vital signs of the human body. Healthcare providers and consultants use such collected data to assess the status of patients in intensive care units (ICU) at hospitals or elderly care facilities. However, the collected data are subject to anomalies caused by faulty sensor readings, malicious attacks, or severe health degradation situations that healthcare professionals should investigate further. As a result, anomaly detection plays a crucial role in maintaining data quality across various real-world applications, including healthcare, where it is vital for the early detection of abnormal health conditions. Numerous techniques for anomaly detection have been proposed in the literature, employing methods like statistical analysis and machine learning to identify anomalies in WBANs. However, the lack of normal datasets makes training supervised machine learning models difficult, highlighting the need for unsupervised approaches. In this paper, a novel, efficient, and effective unsupervised anomaly detection model for WBANs is developed using the autoencoder convolutional neural network (CNN) technique. Due to their ability to reconstruct data in a completely unsupervised manner using reconstruction error, autoencoders hold great potential. Real-world physiological data from the PhysioNet dataset evaluated the suggested model’s performance. The experimental findings demonstrate the model’s efficacy, which provides high detection accuracy, as reported F1-Score is 0.96 with a batch size of 256 along with a mean squared logarithmic error (MSLE) below 0.002. Compared to existing unsupervised models, the proposed model outperforms them in effectiveness and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "As multiple adverse events in 2021 illustrated, virtually all aspects of our societal functioning -- from water and food security to energy supply to healthcare -- more than ever depend on the dynamics of environmental factors. Nevertheless, the social dimensions of weather and climate are noticeably less explored by the machine learning community, largely, due to the lack of reliable and easy access to use data. Here we present a unique not yet broadly available NASA's satellite dataset on aerosol optical depth (AOD), temperature and relative humidity and discuss the utility of these new data for COVID-19 biosurveillance. In particular, using the geometric deep learning models for semi-supervised classification on a county-level basis over the contiguous United States, we investigate the pressing societal question whether atmospheric variables have considerable impact on COVID-19 clinical severity.",

        "title": "Comparing Sampling Strategies for Tackling Imbalanced Data in Human Activity Recognition",
        "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is an increasingly active research topic in machine learning, aided in part by the ready availability of detailed motion capture data from smartphones, fitness trackers, and smartwatches. The goal of HAR is to use such devices to assist users in their daily lives in application areas such as healthcare, physical therapy, and fitness. One of the main challenges for HAR, particularly when using supervised learning methods, is obtaining balanced data for algorithm optimisation and testing. As people perform some activities more than others (e.g., walk more than run), HAR datasets are typically imbalanced. The lack of dataset representation from minority classes hinders the ability of HAR classifiers to sufficiently capture new instances of those activities. We introduce three novel hybrid sampling strategies to generate more diverse synthetic samples to overcome the class imbalance problem. The first strategy, which we call the distance-based method (DBM), combines Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques (SMOTE) with Random_SMOTE, both of which are built around the k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The second technique, referred to as the noise detection-based method (NDBM), combines SMOTE Tomek links (SMOTE_Tomeklinks) and the modified synthetic minority oversampling technique (MSMOTE). The third approach, which we call the cluster-based method (CBM), combines Cluster-Based Synthetic Oversampling (CBSO) and Proximity Weighted Synthetic Oversampling Technique (ProWSyn). We compare the performance of the proposed hybrid methods to the individual constituent methods and baseline using accelerometer data from three commonly used benchmark datasets. We show that DBM, NDBM, and CBM reduce the impact of class imbalance and enhance F1 scores by a range of 9–20 percentage point compared to their constituent sampling methods. CBM performs significantly better than the others under a Friedman test, however, DBM has lower computational requirements.",

        "abstract": "Objective Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are localised skin injuries that cause significant mortality and are costly. Nursing best practices prevent pressure injuries, including time-consuming, complex tasks that lack payment incentives. The Braden Scale is an evidence-based stratification tool nurses use daily to assess pressure-injury risk. Our objective was to analyse the cost-utility of performing repeated risk-assessment for pressure-injury prevention in all patients or high-risk groups. Design Cost-utility analysis using Markov modelling from US societal and healthcare sector perspectives within a 1-year time horizon. Setting Patient-level longitudinal data on 34 787 encounters from an academic hospital electronic health record (EHR) between 2011 and 2014, including daily Braden scores. Supervised machine learning simulated age-adjusted transition probabilities between risk levels and pressure injuries. Participants Hospitalised adults with Braden scores classified into five risk levels: very high risk (6–9), high risk (10–11), moderate risk (12–14), at-risk (15–18), minimal risk (19–23). Interventions Standard care, repeated risk assessment in all risk levels or only repeated risk assessment in high-risk strata based on machine-learning simulations. Main outcome measures Costs (2016 $US) of pressure-injury treatment and prevention, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) related to pressure injuries were weighted by transition probabilities to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at $100 000/QALY willingness-to-pay. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model uncertainty. Results Simulating prevention for all patients yielded greater QALYs at higher cost from societal and healthcare sector perspectives, equating to ICERs of $2000/QALY and $2142/QALY, respectively. Risk-stratified follow-up in patients with Braden scores <15 dominated standard care. Prevention for all patients was cost-effective in >99% of probabilistic simulations. Conclusion Our analysis using EHR data maintains that pressure-injury prevention for all inpatients is cost-effective. Hospitals should invest in nursing compliance with international prevention guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Activity recognition systems have been found to bevery effective for tracking users' activities in research areas like healthcare and assisted living. Wearable accelerometers that can help in classifying Physical Activities (PA) have been made available by MEMS technology. State-of-the-art PAclassification systems use threshold-based techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Each PA may exhibitinter-subject and intra-subject variability which is a major drawback for threshold and machine learning based techniques. Due to lack of empirical data in order to train classifier for ML clustering algorithms, there is a need to develop a mechanism which requires less training data for PA clustering. This paper describes a novel personalized PArecognition model framework based on a semi-supervised clustering approach to avoid fixed threshold techniques and traditional clustering methods by using a single accelerometer. The proposed methodology requires limited amount of data to compute (initial) centroids for PA clusters and achieved an accuracy of about 93% on average, moreover it has the potential capability of recognizing subjects' behavioral shifts and exceptional events, falls, etc.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare providers usually record detailed notes of the clinical care delivered to each patient for clinical, research, and billing purposes. Due to the unstructured nature of these narratives, providers employ dedicated staff to assign diagnostic codes to patients' diagnoses using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system. This manual process is not only time-consuming but also costly and error-prone. Prior work demonstrated potential utility of Machine Learning (ML) methodology in automating this process, but it has relied on large quantities of manually labeled data to train the models. Additionally, diagnostic coding systems evolve with time, which makes traditional supervised learning strategies unable to generalize beyond local applications. In this work, we introduce a general weakly-supervised text classification framework that learns from class-label descriptions only, without the need to use any human-labeled documents. It leverages the linguistic domain knowledge stored within pre-trained language models and the data programming framework to assign code labels to individual texts. We demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of our method by comparing it to state-of-the-art weak text classifiers across four real-world text classification datasets, in addition to assigning ICD codes to medical notes in the publicly available MIMIC-III database.",

        "abstract": "The use of social robots in healthcare systems or nursing homes to assist the elderly and their caregivers will be becoming common, where robots' understanding of engagement of the elderly is important. Traditional engagement estimation (EE) often requires expert involvement in a controlled dyadic interaction environment. In this article, we propose a supervised machine learning method to estimate the engagement state of the elderly in a multiparty human–robot interaction (HRI) scenario from the real‐world video recording as input. The method is built upon the basic concept of engagement in geriatric psychiatry and HRI video representations. It adapts pretrained models to extract behavior, affective, and visual signals to form the multi‐modal features. These features are then fed into a neural network made of a self‐attention mechanism and average pooling for individual learning, a graph attention network for group learning and a fully connected layer to estimate the engagement. We tested the proposed method using 43 wild multiparty elderly robot interaction (ERI) videos. The experimental results show that our method is capable of detecting the key participants and estimating the engagement state of the elderly effectively. Also our study demonstrates the signals from side‐participants in the main interaction group considerably contribute to the EE of the elderly in the multiparty ERI.",

        "abstract": "The recent development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled a significant technology that aids quick healthcare solutions through the use of smart wearables sensors. Indeed, undesirable events and network threats can appear in any physiological recording in Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSN), leading to a misdiagnosis. These events and threats are recognizable by experienced medical staff, thereby it is necessary to identify them before making any diagnosis. In this paper, a secure and energy efficient approach is proposed. For disease detection, our research provide insight into several physiological signals, including the ElectroCardioGram (ECG), ElectroMyoGram (EMG), and Blood Pressure (BP), where the security is achieved by the application of the Advanced Encryption Symmetric (AES) and the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Similarly, to obtain a reasonable range of reliability, a classification procedure based on supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques is used. The simulation results proved the accuracy and sensitivity of the system by 97% and 92%, respectively by enhancing a high level of security. Moreover, a suitable prototype is developed for medical staff to ensure the applicability of our proposal.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) techniques as part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are widely used to solve real world problems. They are widely used in healthcare domain. Many supervised ML techniques are used for heart disease prediction for improving prediction performance. However, it is understood that the accuracy greatly depends on training quality. Training quality gets deteriorated due to curse of dimensionality. In order to overcome third problem, In this study, we introduced a feature selection approach that is AI capable, called Filter Based Feature Selection(FBFS) which is meant for identifying contributing features and discard the features that are irrelevant and redundant. This filter-based approach leads to significant improvement of quality in prediction. With the proposed feature selection method, many ML prediction The empirical study makes use of models including K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Decision Tree, Supervised learning and regression methods, Bayesian Network, XGBoost, and Random Forest. Results from the experiments showed that FBFS had an impact on the estimation techniques. Random Forest model along with FBFS showed higher performance with 95.08% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Prognostic analysis for early-stage (stage I/II) melanomas is of paramount importance for customized surveillance and treatment plans. Since immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been approved for stage IIB and IIC melanomas, prognostic tools to identify patients at high risk of recurrence have become even more critical. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of machine-learning algorithms in predicting melanoma recurrence using clinical and histopathologic features from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We collected 1720 early-stage melanomas: 1172 from the Mass General Brigham healthcare system (MGB) and 548 from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). We extracted 36 clinicopathologic features and used them to predict the recurrence risk with supervised machine-learning algorithms. Models were evaluated internally and externally: (1) five-fold cross-validation of the MGB cohort; (2) the MGB cohort for training and the DFCI cohort for testing independently. In the internal and external validations, respectively, we achieved a recurrence classification performance of AUC: 0.845 and 0.812, and a time-to-event prediction performance of time-dependent AUC: 0.853 and 0.820. Breslow tumor thickness and mitotic rate were identified as the most predictive features. Our results suggest that machine-learning algorithms can extract predictive signals from clinicopathologic features for early-stage melanoma recurrence prediction, which will enable the identification of patients that may benefit from adjuvant immunotherapy.",

        "title": "Synthesizing lesions using contextual GANs improves breast cancer classification on mammograms",
        "abstract": "Data scarcity and class imbalance are two fundamental challenges in many machine learning applications to healthcare. Breast cancer classification in mammography exemplifies these challenges, with a malignancy rate of around 0.5% in a screening population, which is compounded by the relatively small size of lesions (~1% of the image) in malignant cases. Simultaneously, the prevalence of screening mammography creates a potential abundance of non-cancer exams to use for training. Altogether, these characteristics lead to overfitting on cancer cases, while under-utilizing non-cancer data. Here, we present a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) model for data augmentation that can realistically synthesize and remove lesions on mammograms. With self-attention and semi-supervised learning components, the U-net-based architecture can generate high resolution (256x256px) outputs, as necessary for mammography. When augmenting the original training set with the GAN-generated samples, we find a significant improvement in malignancy classification performance on a test set of real mammogram patches. Overall, the empirical results of our algorithm and the relevance to other medical imaging paradigms point to potentially fruitful further applications.",

        "abstract": "Online medical reviews contain patients' subjective evaluations and reflect their satisfaction with the treatment process and doctors. Mining and analysis of sentiment expressed in these medical data may be vital for different applications including adverse drug effects detection, doctor recommendation, and healthcare quality assessment. Nevertheless, medical sentiment analysis is a challenging and complex task because patients who write the reviews are usually non-professional users and tend to use informal language. The problem is more challenging in the Persian language due to its resource scarcity and complex structure. In this study, we introduce PODOR, a Persian dataset of online doctor reviews extracted from social web. Also, we propose a deep model based on the bidirectional long short-term memory for polarity detection of PODOR reviews. To show the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed model, we compared the model with six traditional supervised machine learning methods and three deep models. Preliminary comparative results indicated that our model outperformed traditional methods by 8% and 7%, and deep models by 2% and 3% in terms of accuracy and f1-measure.",

        "title": "An Adaptive Approach for Fake News Detection in Social Media: Single vs Cross Domain",
        "abstract": "The extensive use of online information platforms over traditional news media has amplified the dissemination of fake news. Supervised machine learning based techniques are being extensively used in the detection of fake news in Social Media. However, the performance of such models degrades in the case of cross-domain data scenarios. In this study, we empirically show that the performance of a model depends on the domain-specific and agnostic case. To conduct this study, we extracted the tweets based on the Afghanistan crisis and developed a dataset which we call ’FakeBan’. The country has witnessed the sudden spread of misinformation where several actors are misusing it as ammunition, leading to far-flung troubling implications. We chose to study the most recent Afghanistan and experimented with three completely different domains widely involved in fake news: national crisis, healthcare, and politics. Several advanced datasets are already available in the domain of healthcare and politics. However, it takes a long time to build a labeled dataset based on a recent national crisis. We propose an adaptive fake news detection technique capable of selecting the model based on the domain (single or cross) and thus address the challenging issues arising from the voluminous and highly varied information available on social media. The results of our study affirm that in the case of domain-specific data, machine learning classifiers have performed well using a set of selected features out of twenty-one extracted features. In contrast, deep learning models, particularly the BERT model, have outperformed traditional machine learning classifiers in domain agnostic cases.",

        "abstract": "In the last few years, different machine learning techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning have been effectively employed to solve distinct real-life multidisciplinary problems. These techniques have been effectively applied to accurately predict the problems related to stock values, disease diagnosis, sentiment analysis, text processing, gene classification, crop prediction, and weather forecasting. The objective of this manuscript is to present the systematic review on the use of these techniques in five major domains i.e. agriculture, finance, healthcare, education and engineering. A standard review methodology has been adapted to include and exclude the related literature. The performance of different supervised and nature-inspired computing techniques have been accessed on the basis of different performance metrics. The publication trend on the use of machine learning techniques in these five research areas has been also explored. Finally, the gaps in the study have been identified that will assist prospective researchers who want to pursue their research in these areas.",

        "abstract": "A challenge in developing an ambient activity recognition system for use in elder care is finding a balance between the sophistication of the system and a cost structure that fits within the budgets of public and private sector healthcare organisations. Much activity recognition research in the context of elder care is based on dense networks of sensors and advanced methods, such as supervised machine learning algorithms. This paper presents the data processing aspects of an activity recognition system based on a simpler, knowledge-based unsupervised approach, designed for a sparse network of sensors. By structuring sensor data management as a streaming system, we provide a simple programming model for the application logic, which facilitates building a fault-tolerant system with the potential for distributed data management within the sensor network. The system, evaluated by a public sector healthcare organisation, constitutes an example of a system that is useful and has a sustainable cost structure.",

        "abstract": "In the last years supervised machine learning techniques are largely employed for automatic Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using inertial sensors, such as accelerometer and gyroscope. HAR has many applications in several domains such as, for example, healthcare, sport, and entertainment. Machine learning scientists made available to the community a plenty of labeled databases for benchmarking that, unfortunately, are not consistent, both syntactically (e.g., different sampling frequency) and semantically (e.g., labels with different meanings). Commonly, due to this inconsistency, scientists evaluate their progress on individual databases separately, which corresponds to training and testing using the same database. Coherent merging of existing databases would enable: 1) evaluation of generalization capabilities of methods across databases; 2) use of deep learning techniques that, unlike traditional ones, require much more labeled data for the training process. Moreover, the growth in the daily use of wearable devices will produce a big amount of inertial data which, if not correctly labeled, cannot be efficiently exploited for the study of automatic HAR. In this paper we propose a semi-automatic procedure to coherently merge existing databases based on signal and word similarity. Preliminary experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.",

The case of plasmonic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based tuberculosis disease is utilized as a model experiment. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques are employed for the binary classification based on color moments. Using 10-fold cross validation, the ensemble bagged tree and k-nearest neighbors algorithm achieved 96.1% and 97.6% accuracy, respectively. The use of multi-layer perceptron with Bayesian regularization backpropagation provided 99.2% accuracy. Such high accuracy system can be trained off-line and deployed to mobile devices to produce an automatic colourimetric diagnostic decision anytime anywhere.",

        "abstract": "Smartphone mode classification is essential to many applications, such as daily life monitoring, healthcare, and indoor positioning. In the latter, it was shown that knowledge of the smartphone location on pedestrians can improve the positioning accuracy. Most of the research conducted in this field is focused on pedestrian motion in a horizontal plane. In this research, we use supervised machine learning techniques to recognize and classify the smartphone mode (text, talk, pocket and swing) while accounting for the movement up and downstairs. We distinguish between the going up and the down motion, each with four different smartphone modes, making eight states in total. This classification is based on the use of an optimal set of sensors that varies according to battery life and the energy consumption of each sensor. The classifier was trained and tested on a dataset constructed from multiple user measurements (total of 94 min) to achieve robustness. This provided an accuracy of more than 90% in the cross validation method and 91.5% if the texting mode is excluded. When considering only stairs motion, regardless of the direction, the accuracy improves to 97%. These results may assist many algorithms, mainly in pedestrian dead reckoning, in improving a variety of challenges such as speed and step length estimation and cumulative error reduction.",

        "title": "EDGE: Evolutionary Directed Graph Ensembles",
        "abstract": "Classiﬁcation tasks are being tackled in a plethora of scientiﬁc ﬁelds, such as astronomy, ﬁnance, healthcare, human mobility, and pharmacology, to name a few. Classiﬁcation is deﬁned as a supervised learning approach that uses labeled data to assign instances to classes. A common approach to tackle these tasks are ensemble methods. These are methods that employ a set of models, instead of just one and combine the predictions of every model to obtain the prediction of the whole. Common obstacles in ensemble learning are the choice of base models to use and how best to aggregate the predictions of each individual to produce the ensemble’s prediction. It is also expected to mitigate the weaknesses of its members while pooling their strengths together. It is in this context that Evolutionary Directed Graph Ensembles (EDGE) thrives. EDGE is a machine learning tool based on social dynamics and modeling of trust in human beings using graph theory. Evolutionary Algorithms are used to evolve ensembles of models that are arranged in a directed acyclic graph structure. The connections in the graph map the trust of each node in its predecessors. The novelty in such an approach stems from the fusion of ensemble learning with graphs and evolutionary algorithms. A limitation of EDGE is that it focuses only on changing the topology of the graph ensembles, with the authors of hypothesizing about using the learned graphs for other tasks. with gains as substantial as 30 percentage points. The bootstrap was shown to be effective in improving the prediction power, with the exploitation of previous runs improved the results on 19 out of 21 datasets. The contributions can be summarized as a novel way to evolve graph ensembles, by also evolving the weights between nodes of the graphs, coupled with the idea of bootstrapping any dataset using previous runs from other datasets. The analysis of dataset choice for the bootstrapping lead to the proposal of a similarity metric between datasets that can be used to facilitate the choice for bootstrapping, without exhaustive or random search in the available datasets. uma métrica de semelhança que pode ser utilizada em vez de uma pesquisa exaustiva nos conjuntos de dados disponíveis.",

The freeware fuzzy decision tree induction tool, FDT, is a scalable supervised-classification software tool implementing fuzzy decision trees. It is based on an optimized fuzzy ID3 (FID3) algorithm. FDT 2.0 improves upon FDT 1.0 by bridging the gap between data science and data engineering: it combines a robust decisioning tool with data retention for future decisions, so that the tool does not need to be recalibrated from scratch every time a new decision is required. In this paper we briefly review the analytical capabilities of the freeware FDT tool and its major features and functionalities; examples of large biological datasets from HIV, microRNAs and sRNAs are included. This work shows how to integrate fuzzy decision algorithms with modern database technology. In addition, we show that integrating the fuzzy decision tree induction tool with database storage allows for optimal user satisfaction in today's Data Analytics world.",

        "title": "Detection of Diabetic Foot Ulcers Using SVM Based Classification",
        "abstract": ": Diabetic foot ulcers represent a significant health issue, for both patients’ quality of life and healthcare system costs. Currently, wound care is mainly based on visual assessment of wound size, which suffers from lack of accuracy and consistency. Hence, a more quantitative and computer-based method is needed. Supervised machine learning based object recognition is an attractive option, using training sample images with boundaries labeled by experienced clinicians. We use forty sample images collected from the UMASS Wound Clinic by tracking 8 subjects over 6 months with a smartphone camera. To maintain a consistent imaging environment and facilitate the capture process for patients with limited mobility, an image capture box was designed with two right angled front surface mirrors and LED lighting. We developed a novel foot ulcer recognition system using these sample images as our test data. Instead of operating at the pixel level, we use super-pixels, resulting from the quick shift algorithm, as the basic processing units. Then a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier is trained on the Bag-of-Words histogram representation of local Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features found in each super-pixel. As this classifier is very specific and the resulting histogram is very sparse, we merge the histograms from super-pixels in a size-specified neighborhood into one instance. Finally, to recover more precise boundaries of the foot ulcers, we apply conditional random field techniques to introduce new constraints that allow us to reduce misclassifications that occur",

        "abstract": "Identifying Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) can be challenging due to several factors like wide spectrum of symptoms, that varies according to individual, overlapping symptoms with other conditions like thyroid disorders, adrenal gland disorders, and ovarian tumors. Many women tend to overlook the common indications of PCOS and only seek medical attention when they encounter difficulties in conceiving. The integration of Machine Learning (ML) tools into clinical practice in collaboration with healthcare professionals have guaranteed proper interpretation and clinical decision-making. In this research, we explored the feasibility of developing a model that utilizes ML algorithms and techniques to automate the diagnosis of PCOS. To accomplish this, we utilized a dataset containing information from 543 subjects, encompassing 42 features such as metabolic, imaging, hormonal, and biochemical parameters. Initially, data pre-processing is performed, followed by the implementation of feature selection approach to reduce the number of features. Subsequently, various classification algorithms were trained and evaluated using Decision Tree (DT), XG Boost, Ada Boost, Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR). After conducting a comprehensive analysis, we determined that the XG Boost outperformed the other algorithms in terms achieving high accuracy 92.45%.",

        "title": "Investigating for bias in healthcare algorithms: a sex-stratified analysis of supervised machine learning models in liver disease prediction",
        "abstract": "Objectives The Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) is used extensively to create algorithms that predict liver disease. Given the existing research describing demographic inequities in liver disease diagnosis and management, these algorithms require scrutiny for potential biases. We address this overlooked issue by investigating ILPD models for sex bias. Methods Following our literature review of ILPD papers, the models reported in existing studies are recreated and then interrogated for bias. We define four experiments, training on sex-unbalanced/balanced data, with and without feature selection. We build random forests (RFs), support vector machines (SVMs), Gaussian Naïve Bayes and logistic regression (LR) classifiers, running experiments 100 times, reporting average results with SD. Results We reproduce published models achieving accuracies of >70% (LR 71.31% (2.37 SD) – SVM 79.40% (2.50 SD)) and demonstrate a previously unobserved performance disparity. Across all classifiers females suffer from a higher false negative rate (FNR). Presently, RF and LR classifiers are reported as the most effective models, yet in our experiments they demonstrate the greatest FNR disparity (RF; −21.02%; LR; −24.07%). Discussion We demonstrate a sex disparity that exists in published ILPD classifiers. In practice, the higher FNR for females would manifest as increased rates of missed diagnosis for female patients and a consequent lack of appropriate care. Our study demonstrates that evaluating biases in the initial stages of machine learning can provide insights into inequalities in current clinical practice, reveal pathophysiological differences between the male and females, and can mitigate the digitisation of inequalities into algorithmic systems. Conclusion Our findings are important to medical data scientists, clinicians and policy-makers involved in the implementation medical artificial intelligence systems. An awareness of the potential biases of these systems is essential in preventing the digital exacerbation of healthcare inequalities.",

        "abstract": "Burnout in healthcare professionals (HCPs) is a multi-factorial problem. There are limited studies utilizing machine learning approaches to predict HCPs' burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey consisting of demographic characteristics and work system factors was administered to 450 HCPs during the pandemic (participation rate: 59.3%). The highest performing machine learning model had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.81. The eight key features that best predicted burnout are excessive workload, inadequate staffing, administrative burden, professional relationships, organizational culture, values and expectations, intrinsic motivation, and work-life integration. These findings provide evidence for resource allocation and implementation of interventions to reduce HCPs' burnout and improve the quality of care.",

        "title": "Automatic emotion recognition in healthcare data using supervised machine learning",
        "abstract": "Human feelings are fundamental to perceive the conduct and state of mind of an individual. A healthy emotional state is one significant highlight to improve personal satisfaction. On the other hand, bad emotional health can prompt social or psychological well-being issues. Recognizing or detecting feelings in online health care data gives important and helpful information regarding the emotional state of patients. To recognize or detection of patient’s emotion against a specific disease using text from online sources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic detection of patient’s emotions in healthcare data using supervised machine learning approaches. For this purpose, we created a new dataset named EmoHD, comprising of 4,202 text samples against eight disease classes and six emotion classes, gathered from different online resources. We used six different supervised machine learning models based on different feature engineering techniques. We also performed a detailed comparison of the chosen six machine learning algorithms using different feature vectors on our dataset. We achieved the highest 87% accuracy using MultiLayer Perceptron as compared to other state of the art models. Moreover, we use the emotional guidance scale to show that there is a link between negative emotion and psychological health issues. Our proposed work will be helpful to automatically detect a patient’s emotion during disease and to avoid extreme acts like suicide, mental disorders, or psychological health issues.

With the increase in medical data, ML is penetrating in medical care industry resulting in the integration of Machine Learning algorithms and knowledge of medical personnel and designing of prognostic models which can help doctors and patients to analyze risks of any health compilation. Researchers from health domain are exploring ML algorithms to reach out to some useful conclusions. With this paper we aim to help the researchers to understand the efficiency of available ML algorithms on medical datasets, thus helping them to decide which one to choose from the existing methods. This paper implements 5 Supervised Machine Learning algorithms on four different datasets from health domain on Heart Disease, Diabetes, Dermatology, and Breast Cancer. Results of each of the implemented ML algorithms are compared in terms of prediction accuracy and AUC value on medical datasets. Implementation results suggests that Logistic Regression and Random Forest have shown better results with almost all the datasets used for experiment purpose with accuracy (85%-88%) and AUC value (0.89-0.92). The yield of this paper will add to a better understanding of the use of Machine Learning in the Medical Domain.",

        "abstract": "Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are amongst the most important automated defense mechanisms in modern industry. It is guarding against many attack vectors, especially in healthcare, where sensitive information (patient’s medical history, prescriptions, electronic health records, medical bills/debts, and many other sensitive data points) is open to compromise from adversaries. In the big data era, classical machine learning has been applied to train IDS. However, classical IDS tend to be complex: either using several hidden layers susceptible to overfitting on training data or using overly complex architectures such as convolutional neural networks, long-short term memory systems, and recurrent neural networks. This article explored the combination of principles of quantum mechanics and neural networks to train IDS. A hybrid classical-quantum neural architecture is proposed with a quantum-assisted activation function that successfully captures patterns in the dataset while having less architectural memory footprint than classical solutions. The experimental results are demonstrated on the popular KDD99 dataset while comparing our solution to other classical models.",

        "title": "Personalized Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Wellbeing and Empathy in Healthcare Professionals",
        "abstract": "Healthcare professionals are known to suffer from workplace stress and burnout, which can negatively affect their empathy for patients and quality of care. While existing research has identified factors associated with wellbeing and empathy in healthcare professionals, these efforts are typically focused on the group level, ignoring potentially important individual differences and implications for individualized intervention approaches. In the current study, we implemented N-of-1 personalized machine learning (PML) to predict wellbeing and empathy in healthcare professionals at the individual level, leveraging ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and smartwatch wearable data. A total of 47 mood and lifestyle feature variables (relating to sleep, diet, exercise, and social connections) were collected daily for up to three months followed by applying eight supervised machine learning (ML) models in a PML pipeline to predict wellbeing and empathy separately. Predictive insight into the model architecture was obtained using Shapley statistics for each of the best-fit personalized models, ranking the importance of each feature for each participant. The best-fit model and top features varied across participants, with anxious mood (13/19) and depressed mood (10/19) being the top predictors in most models. Social connection was a top predictor for wellbeing in 9/12 participants but not for empathy models (1/7). Additionally, empathy and wellbeing were the top predictors of each other in 64% of cases. These findings highlight shared and individual features of wellbeing and empathy in healthcare professionals and suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing modifiable factors to improve wellbeing and empathy will likely be suboptimal. In the future, such personalized models may serve as actionable insights for healthcare professionals that lead to increased wellness and quality of patient care.",

        "title": "Supervised Machine Learning Chatbots for Perinatal Mental Healthcare",
        "abstract": "Perinatal mental health (PMH) problems are types of mood disorders which arise during pregnancy and within 24 months after the birth of a child, which affects pregnant women, newborns and family relationships. These problems may occur at any stage of maternal women. PMH is mainly diagnosed through behavioral observation, self-reporting, and behavioral scale testing. Chatbot is an effective technology. Through human-robot interaction, it can monitor the mental health status of perinatal women in real time while collecting user health data. The application of human-robot interaction in mental health services has attracted widespread attention. Compared with traditional methods, robot intervention in mental health care can help reduce the obstacles for subjects to seek help for mental health, and can collect more comprehensive and detailed data of patients, which helps users recognize their own mental health level, and can also help clinicians make diagnoses more accurately and in a timely manner. In this article, the author proposes a chatbot to monitor and assess the mental state of perinatal women. This article uses supervised machine learning to analyze the 31 characteristics of 223 samples, and trains a model to determine the anxiety, depression and hypomania index of perinatal women. Meanwhile, psychological test scales are used to assist in evaluation and make treatment suggestions to help users improve their mental health.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare fraud is intentionally submitting false claims or producing misinterpretation of facts to obtain entitlement payments. Thus, it wastes healthcare financial resources and increases healthcare costs. Subsequently, fraud poses a substantial financial challenge. Therefore, supervised machine and deep learning analytics such as random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks are successfully used to detect healthcare insurance fraud. This study aims to develop a health model that automatically detects fraud from health insurance claims in Saudi Arabia. The model indicates the greatest contributing factor to fraud with optimal accuracy. The labeled imbalanced dataset used three supervised deep and machine learning methods. The dataset was obtained from three healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia. The applied models were random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. The SMOT technique was used to balance the dataset. Boruta object feature selection was applied to exclude insignificant features. Validation metrics were accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Random forest classifiers indicated policy type, education, and age as the most significant features with an accuracy of 98.21%, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, an F1 score of 99.03%, specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 90.00%. Logistic regression resulted in an accuracy of 80.36%, 97.62% precision, 80.39% recall, an F1 score of 88.17%, specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 80.20%. ANN revealed an accuracy of 94.64%, 98.00% precision, 96.08% recall, an F1 score of 97.03%, a specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 88.04%. This predictive analytics study applied three successful models, each of which yielded acceptable accuracy and validation metrics; however, further research on a larger dataset is advised.",

        "abstract": "Biomarkers play a crucial role in various aspects of healthcare, offering valuable insights into disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as effective tools for uncovering novel biomarkers and improving predictive modelling capabilities. However, bias within ML algorithms, particularly regarding sex-based disparities, remains a concern. In this study, a supervised ML model was developed in order to predict 9 common biomarkers widely used in clinical settings. These biomarkers included triglycerides, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, uric acid, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, high-density lipoproteins and albuminuria. During the validation test, it was observed that the ML models successfully predicted values within 5 and 10% error of the actual values. Out of the 121 female individuals tested, the following percentages of predicted values fell within this 10% range: 93% for albuminuria, 86% for waist circumference, 76% for BMI, and the lowest being 64% for systolic blood pressure and blood glucose. For the 119 male individuals tested, the percentages were as follows: 92% for albuminuria, 96% for waist circumference, 91% for BMI, 74% for blood glucose, and 68% for systolic blood pressure. Triglycerides, uric acid, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and high-density lipoproteins all predicted lower than 50% for both male and female subgroups. Overall, the male subgroup had higher prediction scores than the female group. Graphical Abstract",

        "abstract": "Over time, technological advancements have had an immense effect on every aspect of life, including travel, office work, music, healthcare, and communication. In the past, people communicated using telephone lines. With far more functionality than telephone cable technology, wireless technology already prevails. SMS is mostly used by spammers and advertising firms to communicate with the general public and distribute company pamphlets. This explains why over 60% of spam SMS are sent and received every day. Although these spam communications irritate users and occasionally con unsuspecting users, the spammers and ad businesses benefit handsomely from them. This paper suggested a method for categorizing ham and spam SMS using supervised machine learning approaches. Features are extracted from data using feature extraction techniques like bag-of- words and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The imbalance in the SMS dataset we used was addressed by applying both oversampling and under sampling techniques. The support vector classifier, gradient boosting machine, random forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and logistics regression are implemented on the using spam SMS and ham SMS data sets, evaluated by F1 score, accuracy, precision and recall are used to assess performance. According to the experiment's findings, the random forest diagnoses spam and ham SMS more precisely-99% of the time.",

        "abstract": "Early identification of heart attack is essential and predicting it using clinical data is a complex process due to the multifaceted nature of the disease and the diverse range of contributing factors. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are powerful tools for predicting heart disease by analyzing patient healthcare data. This paper explores the predictive analysis of heart attack using supervised ML algorithms: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. AdaBoost is a simple ensemble algorithm that improves the performance of weak learners by focusing on misclassified instances. CART is highly interpretable and efficient in handling non-linear data relationships. Random Forest is a robust algorithm that aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees to produce accurate predictions. A comprehensive dataset comprising various cardiovascular health indicators is used to evaluate these algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly enhance prediction accuracy upto 96%.",

        "title": "Identifying diseases symptoms and general rules using supervised and unsupervised machine learning",
        "abstract": "The symptoms of diseases can vary among individuals and may remain undetected in the early stages. Detecting these symptoms is crucial in the initial stage to effectively manage and treat cases of varying severity. Machine learning has made major advances in recent years, proving its effectiveness in various healthcare applications. This study aims to identify patterns of symptoms and general rules regarding symptoms among patients using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The integration of a rule-based machine learning technique and classification methods is utilized to extend a prediction model. This study analyzes patient data that was available online through the Kaggle repository. After preprocessing the data and exploring descriptive statistics, the Apriori algorithm was applied to identify frequent symptoms and patterns in the discovered rules. Additionally, the study applied several machine learning models for predicting diseases, including stepwise regression, support vector machine, bootstrap forest, boosted trees, and neural-boosted methods. Several predictive machine learning models were applied to the dataset to predict diseases. It was discovered that the stepwise method for fitting outperformed all competitors in this study, as determined through cross-validation conducted for each model based on established criteria. Moreover, numerous significant decision rules were extracted in the study, which can streamline clinical applications without the need for additional expertise. These rules enable the prediction of relationships between symptoms and diseases, as well as between different diseases. Therefore, the results obtained in this study have the potential to improve the performance of prediction models. We can discover diseases symptoms and general rules using supervised and unsupervised machine learning for the dataset. Overall, the proposed algorithm can support not only healthcare professionals but also patients who face cost and time constraints in diagnosing and treating these diseases.",

        "title": "ECG Heartbeat Classification Using Machine Learning and Metaheuristic Optimization for Smart Healthcare Systems",
        "abstract": "Early diagnosis and classification of arrhythmia from an electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a significant role in smart healthcare systems for the health monitoring of individuals with cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, the nonlinearity and low amplitude of ECG recordings make the classification process difficult. Thus, the performance of most traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers is questionable, as the interrelationship between the learning parameters is not well modeled, especially for data features with high dimensions. To address the limitations of ML classifiers, this paper introduces an automatic arrhythmia classification approach based on the integration of a recent metaheuristic optimization (MHO) algorithm and ML classifiers. The role of the MHO is to optimize the search parameters of the classifiers. The approach consists of three steps: the preprocessing of the ECG signal, the extraction of the features, and the classification. The learning parameters of four supervised ML classifiers were utilized for the classification task; support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNNs), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and random forest (RF) were optimized using the MHO algorithm. To validate the advantage of the proposed approach, several experiments were conducted on three common databases, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT-BIH), the European Society of Cardiology ST-T (EDB), and the St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Techniques 12-lead Arrhythmia (INCART). The obtained results showed that the performance of all the tested classifiers were significantly improved after integrating the MHO algorithm, with the average ECG arrhythmia classification accuracy reaching 99.92% and a sensitivity of 99.81%, outperforming the state-of the-art methods.",

        "title": "Hybridizing Artificial Neural Networks Through Feature Selection Based Supervised Weight Initialization and Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms for Improved Colon Cancer Prediction",
        "abstract": "Computer-aided decision support systems (DSSs) are becoming popular in a variety of professions. Notably, medical DSSs assist healthcare professionals (decision makers) choose the optimal course of action (decisions) while treating patients. Such systems help decision-makers in situations when there is uncertainty in manual decisions due to lack of information or expertise. Choosing a suitable learning algorithm in a DSS is essential and affects its performance. Among machine learning (ML) algorithms, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are considered the most suitable framework for many classification tasks. In healthcare, an ML-based prediction system/DSS employs data (genetic profile or clinical characteristics) and learning algorithms to forecast target values, which may give promising results. However, improving prediction accuracy is a crucial step in making informed decisions. One can apply various preprocessing methods (cross validation, feature selection, bagging, boosting, etc.) to achieve this. For complex classification tasks like cancer, decision-makers can utilize the hybridization of classifiers to increase prediction accuracy. The presented study investigates the possibilities of improvements in the design of hybridized systems for DSSs to assist healthcare professionals in robust decision-making before, during, and after cancer diagnosis. Since the network weights and the activation functions are the two crucial elements in the learning process of an ANN, this study is organized to investigates the improvement in the hybrid system by selecting suitable features from gene expression microarray data and using these features to compute the more realistic initial weights instead of using random guesses as initial weights for ANN. The use of the proposed framework gives promising results (upto 6.67% gain in accuracy when compared to previous study (Table-5) while 10.43% increase in accuracy when compared to conventional ML classifiers (Table-4).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Surveillance of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) is the foundation of infection control. Machine learning (ML) has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for HAI surveillance. We compared manual surveillance with a supervised, semiautomated, ML method, and we explored the types of infection and features of importance depicted by the model. Methods: From July 2021 to December 2021, a semiautomated surveillance method based on the ML random forest algorithm, was implemented in a Brazilian hospital. Inpatient records were independently manually searched by the local team, and a panel of independent experts reviewed the ML semiautomated results for confirmation of HAI. Results: Among 6,296 patients, manual surveillance classified 183 HAI cases (2.9%), and a semiautomated method found 299 HAI cases (4.7%). The semiautomated method added 77 respiratory infections, which comprised 93.9% of the additional HAIs. The ML model considered 447 features for HAI classification. Among them, 148 features (33.1%) were related to infection signs and symptoms; 101 (22.6%) were related to patient severity status, 51 features (11.4%) were related to bacterial laboratory results; 40 features (8.9%) were related to invasive procedures; 34 (7.6%) were related to antibiotic use; and 31 features (6.9%) were related to patient comorbidities. Among these 447 features, 229 (51.2%) were similar to those proposed by NHSN as criteria for HAI classification. Conclusion: The ML algorithm, which included most NHSN criteria and >200 features, augmented the human capacity for HAI classification. Well-documented algorithm performances may facilitate the incorporation of AI tools in clinical or epidemiological practice and overcome the drawbacks of traditional HAI surveillance.",

        "title": "Best Practices in Supervised Machine Learning: A Tutorial for Psychologists",
        "abstract": "Supervised machine learning (ML) is becoming an influential analytical method in psychology and other social sciences. However, theoretical ML concepts and predictive-modeling techniques are not yet widely taught in psychology programs. This tutorial is intended to provide an intuitive but thorough primer and introduction to supervised ML for psychologists in four consecutive modules. After introducing the basic terminology and mindset of supervised ML, in Module 1, we cover how to use resampling methods to evaluate the performance of ML models (bias-variance trade-off, performance measures, k-fold cross-validation). In Module 2, we introduce the nonlinear random forest, a type of ML model that is particularly user-friendly and well suited to predicting psychological outcomes. Module 3 is about performing empirical benchmark experiments (comparing the performance of several ML models on multiple data sets). Finally, in Module 4, we discuss the interpretation of ML models, including permutation variable importance measures, effect plots (partial-dependence plots, individual conditional-expectation profiles), and the concept of model fairness. Throughout the tutorial, intuitive descriptions of theoretical concepts are provided, with as few mathematical formulas as possible, and followed by code examples using the mlr3 and companion packages in R. Key practical-analysis steps are demonstrated on the publicly available PhoneStudy data set (N = 624), which includes more than 1,800 variables from smartphone sensing to predict Big Five personality trait scores. The article contains a checklist to be used as a reminder of important elements when performing, reporting, or reviewing ML analyses in psychology. Additional examples and more advanced concepts are demonstrated in online materials (https://osf.io/9273g/).",

An important concern in clinical data processing is the diagnosis of heart disease. The enormous amount of information collected by the healthcare field has been established as helpful for using machine learning (ML) to help with judgement and prediction. In this work, four supervised machine learning techniques such as K-nearest neighbour (KNN), Multi-layer perceptron Decision Tree (DT) and REPTree have been used for predicting heart disease. The developed classifier model is tested with “Heart disease Prediction” obtained from Kaggle Repository. The performance metrics used to evaluate the classifier models are accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. The existing four machine learning classifiers has been evaluated to forecast cardiac diseases and obtained maximum accuracy of 99.7% for KNN classifier.",

        "abstract": "The healthcare business faces significant challenges in successfully maintaining and evaluating large amounts of patient data. Data analytics has emerged as a viable tool for issue resolution and decision-making as a result of technological advancements in healthcare. This automated procedure improves the resilience of healthcare systems by collecting and analyzing data to provide more effective and cost-effective treatments. One critical use of technology, primarily machine learning, involves the identification and diagnosis of diseases, notably heart disease, which contributes significantly to global mortality. This research study analyzes how machine learning methods (NB, RF, SVM, and LR) can predict the existence of heart disease. Given that nearly 90% of cardiac diseases are avoidable, using machine learning for prediction is critical. This research study assesses the performance of different algorithms using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, area under the curve (AUC), and F1-Score. The experimental results reveal Random Forest (RF) as the most reliable predictor of heart disease with an accuracy of 83.52% compared to other supervised machine learning algorithms. The Random Forest classifier achieves F1-Score, AUC, and accuracy values of 84.21 %, 88.24%, and 88.89%, respectively. This study highlights the potential of ML, notably the Random Forest algorithm, in improving the predictive capacity of healthcare systems for more effective heart disease prevention and treatment.",

        "title": "Employing advanced supervised machine learning approaches for predicting micronutrient intake status among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia",
        "abstract": "Background Although micronutrients (MNs) are important for children’s growth and development, their intake has not received enough attention. MN deficiency is a significant public health problem, especially in developing countries like Ethiopia. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence using advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning. Therefore, this study aimed to use advanced supervised algorithms to predict the micronutrient intake status in Ethiopian children aged 6–23 months. Methods A total weighted of 2,499 children aged 6–23 months from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data set were utilized. The data underwent preprocessing, with 80% of the observations used for training and 20% for testing the model. Twelve machine learning algorithms were employed. To select best predictive model, their performance was assessed using different evaluation metrics in Python software. The Boruta algorithm was used to select the most relevant features. Besides, seven data balancing techniques and three hyper parameter tuning methods were employed. To determine the association between independent and targeted feature, association rule mining was conducted using the a priori algorithm in R software. Results According to the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, out of 2,499 weighted children aged 12–23 months, 1,728 (69.15%) had MN intake. The random forest, catboost, and light gradient boosting algorithm outperformed in predicting MN intake status among all selected classifiers. Region, wealth index, place of delivery, mothers’ occupation, child age, fathers’ educational status, desire for more children, access to media exposure, religion, residence, and antenatal care (ANC) follow-up were the top attributes to predict MN intake. Association rule mining was identified the top seven best rules that most frequently associated with MN intake among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia. Conclusion The random forest, catboost, and light gradient boosting algorithm achieved a highest performance and identifying the relevant predictors of MN intake. Therefore, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop targeted interventions to enhance the uptake of micronutrient supplementation among children. Customizing strategies based on identified association rules has the potential to improve child health outcomes and decrease the impact of micronutrient deficiencies in Ethiopia.",

        "abstract": "In the past decade, we have seen many patients and healthcare problems. Due to this, patients find difficulty choosing doctors according to their disease. Several Machine Learning (ML) based techniques already exist to predict doctors based on patient’s health conditions. However, it is essential to accurately recommend doctors to patients with low errors based on patients’ health conditions. Therefore, we propose a method that assigns quantitative importance (weight) to each feature using an ML technique. Moreover, we offer a framework to recommend doctors based on the similarity score and doctor’s skill score, which utilizes weight prediction to enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, on real-world datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated empirically by lowering the average loss by roughly 34% and 3% as compared to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), respectively. The outcome demonstrates that the algorithm can efficiently recommend doctors to patients compared to state-of-the-art techniques. This analysis technique aid patients in opting for the right doctor.",

        "title": "An application of a supervised machine learning model for predicting life expectancy",
        "abstract": "The social and financial systems of many nations throughout the world are significantly impacted by life expectancy (LE) models. Numerous studies have pointed out the crucial effects that life expectancy projections will have on societal issues and the administration of the global healthcare system. The computation of life expectancy has primarily entailed building an ordinary life table. However, the life table is limited by its long duration, the assumption of homogeneity of cohorts and censoring. As a result, a robust and more accurate approach is inevitable. In this study, a supervised machine learning model for estimating life expectancy rates is developed. The model takes into consideration health, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics by using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to data from 193 UN member states. The effectiveness of the model’s prediction is compared to that of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regressors utilized in earlier research. XGBoost attains an MAE and an RMSE of 1.554 and 2.402, respectively outperforming the RF and ANN models that achieved MAE and RMSE values of 7.938 and 11.304, and 3.86 and 5.002, respectively. The overall results of this study support XGBoost as a reliable and efficient model for estimating life expectancy. This work develops a model that takes into consideration health, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics in predicting life expectancy to address the limitations of traditional life expectancy models, such as the ordinary life table. The comparison of the effectiveness of the model’s prediction with that of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regressors is performed. The reliability and efficiency of XGBoost in estimating life expectancy is assessed and established to be superior to Random Forest model, with implications to societal issues and global healthcare administration.

        "title": "Cerebrovascular Accident Prognosis using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms",
        "abstract": "Cerebral vascular problems, such as stroke, have become a major concern in healthcare due to their impact on neurological health. Early detection of these illnesses can considerably enhance patient outcomes and lead proper treatment choices. Recently, supervised machine learning algorithms have emerged as potential techniques for anticipating cerebrovascular diseases utilizing numerous clinical indicators. This study compares the predictive performance of three supervised learning algorithms, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost, in the context of cerebrovascular disease prediction. The dataset utilized for training and evaluation comprises a variety of clinical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and medical history. Random Forest has the highest prediction accuracy of the three algorithms, at 99.93% for cerebrovascular diseases. This result demonstrates how effective and reliable Random Forest’s pattern detection algorithms are in this dataset. With a near accuracy of 97.94%, XGBoost exhibits a good capacity for prediction. Decision Tree nevertheless obtains an excellent accuracy of 97.53% despite somewhat inferior performance compared to XGBoost, making it a competitive choice for the prediction of cerebrovascular disease. These results outperform the most recent state-of-the-art results and show a considerable increase in accuracy when compared to existing methods. The study emphasizes how well supervised learning systems, in particular Random Forest, capture the complex relationships between clinical parameters for accurate predictions of cerebrovascular diseases. The outstanding accuracy of these models highlights their potential for accurate cerebrovascular prediction in clinical practice.",

        "title": "Evaluating the Performance of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Multiple Diseases: A Comparative Study",
        "abstract": "Machine learning has become one of the most popular and widely used techniques in various industries, especially in the healthcare sector. This paper focuses on examining the performance analysis of several machine learning algorithms and conducting a comparative analysis to determine which algorithm performs best in predicting six different diseases, such as cardiovascular, heart, stroke, Alzheimer, breast, and lung cancer, with various metrics. The Multi Disease Dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains various instances and attributes. The proposed model involves two stages of data preprocessing, including missing value replacement and label encoding. Additionally, Six diverse supervised machine learning classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), were analyzed. Also the AdaBoost and Soft voting classifier were analyzed and compared to the accuracy of all the algorithms. The comparative analysis showed that the Voting Classifier performed best in predicting most of the diseases, and Support Vector Machine and AdaBoost also performed well in terms of Precision, Sensitivity, and Specificity metrics. SVM achieved a classification accuracy of 91.9% for Alzheimer’s Disease, 88.7% for Lung Cancer, while the Voting Classifier, which is an ensemble of the mentioned ML algorithms, achieved accuracy of 77% for Heart Disease, 78.2% for Cardiovascular Disease, 91.4% for Breast Cancer, and 95% for Stroke, outperforming the other machine learning algorithms. The classification accuracy of the Voting Classifier was similar to that of SVM and AdaBoost in multi-disease prediction",

        "abstract": "Influenza has been a stationary disease in Mexico since 2009, and this causes a high cost for the national public health system, including its detection using RT-qPCR tests, treatments, and absenteeism in the workplace. Despite influenza’s relevance, the main clinical features to detect the disease defined by international institutions like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do not follow the same pattern in all populations. The aim of this work is to find a machine learning method to facilitate decision making in the clinical differentiation between positive and negative influenza patients, based on their symptoms and demographic features. The research sample consisted of 15480 records, including clinical and demographic data of patients with a positive/negative RT-qPCR influenza tests, from 2010 to 2020 in the public healthcare institutions of Mexico City. The performance of the methods for classifying influenza cases were evaluated with indices like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, the f1-measure and the area under the curve (AUC). Results indicate that random forest and bagging classifiers were the best supervised methods; they showed promise in supporting clinical diagnosis, especially in places where performing molecular tests might be challenging or not feasible.",

        "title": "Cancer Death Cases Forecasting using Supervised Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "In India, like in the rest of the world, cancer is a major killer. This research objective is to predict cancer mortality in India, using supervised machine learning methods. Cancer mortality rates in India between 1990 and 2017 are provided by age group, gender, and region using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study. We employ three distinct supervised learning algorithms—linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression—after performing data preprocessing, which includes missing value imputation and feature engineering. Using a variety of criteria, we analyze the effectiveness of these models and conclude that the random forest regression model is superior to the other two. The scope of research is provide a long-term prediction of cancer mortality in India using the best model so it will help health department to work on it. Our research has implications for policymakers and healthcare providers in India, where it may inform efforts to reduce cancer rates and improve cancer care.",

        "abstract": "For aspect, a convolution Neural Network (CNN) for cardiac arrest would help establish a better output. Whilst a cardiac arrest occurs, the limited interventions available to shop-affected person’s lives are related to badly affected outcomes. Therefore, the best way to enhance affected person results and lower related healthcare prices might be to prevent cardiac arrest. This remark highlights the significance of prediction models that continuously perceive excessive-risk individuals and assist healthcare providers in providing centered care to the appropriate patient at the appropriate time for the early identification of cardiac arrest patients who may need immediate medical attention. Moreover, the significant aspect lies in the proper symmetry formation or can, say, the better scenario to compute or make a clear recognition of the image having a clear resolution of the image. Starting with a small model to determine things as simple as CNN (Convolution Neural Network). In this proposed paper, we are used in seven different supervised machine learning method for simulation of ECG data set results in different time interval with different duration and amplitude. In the CNN with a partially connected convolution layer, the image has a single neuron connected to a small layer region. The CNN (convolution Neural Network) image classification takes the input, processes it and classification is done on the dimensions organized in three dimensions width, height, and depth.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health concern that has spread around the globe. Machine Learning is promising in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Machine learning and artificial intelligence have been employed by various healthcare providers, scientists, and clinicians in medical industries in the fight against COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption habit changes among healthcare workers in the United States during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. We utilize multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and models such as decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, Chi-Squared Test, mutual information, KModes clustering and the synthetic minority oversampling technique on a mental health survey data obtained from the University of Michigan Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research to investigate the links between COVID-19-related deleterious effects and changes in alcohol consumption habits among healthcare workers. Through the interpretation of the supervised and unsupervised methods, we have concluded that healthcare workers whose children stayed home during the first wave in the US consumed more alcohol. We also found that the work schedule changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic led to a change in alcohol use habits. Changes in food consumption, age, gender, geographical characteristics, changes in sleep habits, the amount of news consumption, and screen time are also important predictors of an increase in alcohol use among healthcare workers in the United States.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In developing countries, child health and restraining under-five child mortality are one of the fundamental concerns. UNICEF adopted sustainable development goal 3 (SDG3) to reduce the under-five child mortality rate globally to 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. The under-five mortality rate is 69 deaths per 1,000 live child-births in Pakistan as reported by the Demographic and Health Survey (2018). Predictive analytics has the power to transform the healthcare industry, personalizing care for every individual. Pakistan Demographic Health Survey (2017–2018), the publicly available dataset, is used in this study and multiple imputation methods are adopted for the treatment of missing values. The information gain, a feature selection method, ranked the information-rich features and examine their impact on child mortality prediction. The synthetic minority over-sampling method (SMOTE) balanced the training dataset, and four supervised machine learning classifiers have been used, namely the decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, naive Bayes classifier, and extreme gradient boosting classifier. For comparative analysis, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score have been used. Eventually, a predictive analytics framework is built that predicts whether the child is alive or dead. The number under-five children in a household, preceding birth interval, family members, mother age, age of mother at first birth, antenatal care visits, breastfeeding, child size at birth, and place of delivery were found to be critical risk factors for child mortality. The random forest classifier performed efficiently and predicted under-five child mortality with accuracy (93.8%), precision (0.964), recall (0.971), and F1-score (0.967). The findings could greatly assist child health intervention programs in decision-making.",

The Cochrane Back Review Group proposed 'Holy Grail' questions, one being: 'What are the most important (preventable) predictors of chronicity' for patients with LBP? Subsequently, prognostic factors influencing outcomes for CLBP have been described, however results remain conflicting due to methodological weaknesses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective observational cohort study examined prognostic risk factors for PT outcomes in CLBP treatment using a sub-type of AI. Bootstrap random forest supervised machine learning analysis was employed to identify the outcomes-associated variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe top variables identified as predictive were: FOTO™ predicted functional status (FS) change score; FOTO™ predicted number of visits; initial FS score, age; history of jogging/walking, obesity, and previous treatments; provider education level; medication use; gender.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis article presents how AI can be used to predict risk prognostic factors in healthcare research. Improving predictive accuracy helps clinicians predict outcomes and determine most appropriate plans of care and may impact research attrition rates.",

        "abstract": "(1) One in four hospital readmissions is potentially preventable. Machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict hospital readmissions and risk-stratify patients, but thus far they have been limited in clinical applicability, timeliness, and generalizability. (2) Methods: Using deidentified clinical data from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) between January 2016 and November 2021, we developed and compared four supervised ML models (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost) to predict 30-day readmissions for adults admitted to a UCSF hospital. (3) Results: Of 147,358 inpatient encounters, 20,747 (13.9%) patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The final model selected was XGBoost, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.783 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.434. The most important features by Shapley Additive Explanations were days since last admission, discharge department, and inpatient length of stay. (4) Conclusions: We developed and internally validated a supervised ML model to predict 30-day readmissions in a US-based healthcare system. This model has several advantages including state-of-the-art performance metrics, the use of clinical data, the use of features available within 24 h of discharge, and generalizability to multiple disease states.",

        "abstract": "Improved patient care and less mental strain on healthcare providers are two benefits of using algorithms for machine learning to healthcare data. These algorithms may be used to spot irregularities in vital signs, which might speed up medical assistance or provide light on a disease's progression. While there is a wealth of literature comparing the unsupervised and supervised performances of anomaly detection algorithms on popular public datasets, this same level of conceptual comparison is lacking when it comes to physiological data. Knowing one's heart rate may provide valuable insight on one's health and level of physical activity, making it an underutilised data source. Specifically, we used and compared five machine learning methods, two of which were unsupervised and the other three supervised, to identify outliers in heart rate data. The algorithms were tested using physiological data from human subjects' hearts. Results demonstrated that both outlier factor and regression trees algorithms were effective in detecting heart rate anomalies, with both models successfully generalising from their simulation heart rate data training to real-world heart rate data. In addition, the findings lend credence to the idea that, in the absence of real labelled data, simulated data can be used to configure methodologies to a certain degree of performance, indicating that this kind of training could be particularly useful in the initial rollout of a system with no preexisting data.",

        "abstract": "Twitter has become a popular platform for sharing health information, including diabetes-related content. Recent research studies have shown that Twitter data can be used for various purposes such as monitoring illnesses, promoting health, analyzing sentiment, and potentially aiding in medical directing. However, detecting fitness-related tweets in the vast amount of data on Twitter can be difficult. This pilot study, therefore, aimed to classify patient text about drugs and disease-associated tweets into meaningful health-related segments. The unlabeled dataset is divided into several groups using an unsupervised learning technique called K-Means Clustering, using this first label the text and followed by a combination of neural networks and machine learning classifiers, they classified 32046 diabetes-related tweets and 161290 drug text lines into five groups. Approximately 66.38% of drug line text was classified as health-related, with 55.14% “treatment and medication”, 7.10% “prevention” and 4.14% “symptoms and causes”. Over 33% were categorized as “Other and News”. If we talk about the tweets as a dataset then the tweet was classified as health-related, with 44.30% “treatment and medication”, 7% “prevention” and 5.3% “symptoms and causes”. Over 56.10% were categorized as “Other and News. After this multiclass classification, we applied three machine learning and two deep learning models to find accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. Drug review was used as a dataset then SVM and LR models provided an accuracy of 98% and when tweets were used as a dataset then LR models provided an accuracy of 97%. This research shows the importance of social media data in the decision-making system in the healthcare domain.",

        "title": "Risk Prediction Modeling for Breast Cancer using Supervised Machine Learning Approaches",
        "abstract": "Millions of people worldwide are affected by breast cancer, a complicated and possibly fatal disease. For patients to have better outcomes and have higher survival rates, early detection and precise diagnosis are essential. The importance of machine learning methods in breast cancer research has grown as a result of their capacity to manage complicated and varied medical data. This study compares the performance of machine learning models on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). Through the use of a variety of factors, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, & F1-Score, the research seeks to assess the models' performance. The findings demonstrate that these machine learning models predict breast cancer very effectively, with accuracy rates ranging from 95.71% to 98.57%. The ANN model detected every instance of breast cancer with the best accuracy and sensitivity. The performance of the RF and Logistic Regression models was balanced, however the SVM model had a little lower specificity. The F1-Scores show that these models have a good balance between accuracy and recall. These results demonstrate the possibility of early identification and enhanced patient care offered by machine learning in the prediction of breast cancer. Overall, ML has enormous promise for improving the prognosis and detection of breast cancer, lowering the chance of misdiagnosis, and expediting the diagnostic procedure, which will eventually benefit patients and the healthcare industry.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) integration in healthcare improves patient care while also making healthcare delivery systems more effective and economical. To fully realize the advantages of IoT in healthcare, it is imperative to overcome issues with data security, interoperability, and ethical considerations. IoT sensors periodically measure the health-related data of the patients and share it with a server for further evaluation. At the server, different machine learning algorithms are applied which help in early diagnosis of diseases and issue alerts in case vital signs are out of the normal range. Different cyber attacks can be launched on IoT devices which can result in compromised security and privacy of applications such as health care. In this paper, we utilize the publicly available Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) IoT dataset to model machine learning techniques for efficient detection of anomalous network traffic. The dataset consists of 33 types of IoT attacks which are divided into 7 main categories. In the current study, the dataset is pre-processed, and a balanced representation of classes is used in generating a non-biased supervised (Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Logistic Regression, Perceptron, Deep Neural Network) machine learning models. These models are analyzed further by eliminating highly correlated features, reducing dimensionality, minimizing overfitting, and speeding up training times. Random Forest was found to perform optimally across binary and multiclass classification of IoT Attacks with an approximate accuracy of 99.55% under both reduced and all feature space. This improvement was complimented by a reduction in computational response time which is essential for real-time attack detection and response.",

        "abstract": "The global healthcare sector continues to grow rapidly and is reflected as one of the fastest-growing sectors in the fourth industrial revolution (4.0). The majority of the healthcare industry still uses labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone traditional, manual, and manpower-based methods. This review addresses the current paradigm, the potential for new scientific discoveries, the technological state of preparation, the potential for supervised machine learning (SML) prospects in various healthcare sectors, and ethical issues. The effectiveness and potential for innovation of disease diagnosis, personalized medicine, clinical trials, non-invasive image analysis, drug discovery, patient care services, remote patient monitoring, hospital data, and nanotechnology in various learning-based automation in healthcare along with the requirement for explainable artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare are evaluated. In order to understand the potential architecture of non-invasive treatment, a thorough study of medical imaging analysis from a technical point of view is presented. This study also represents new thinking and developments that will push the boundaries and increase the opportunity for healthcare through AI and SML in the near future. Nowadays, SML-based applications require a lot of data quality awareness as healthcare is data-heavy, and knowledge management is paramount. Nowadays, SML in biomedical and healthcare developments needs skills, quality data consciousness for data-intensive study, and a knowledge-centric health management system. As a result, the merits, demerits, and precautions need to take ethics and the other effects of AI and SML into consideration. The overall insight in this paper will help researchers in academia and industry to understand and address the future research that needs to be discussed on SML in the healthcare and biomedical sectors.",

This survey paper provides essential definitions, an overview of the different principles and methodologies of explainable Supervised Machine Learning (SML). We conduct a state-of-the-art survey that reviews past and recent explainable SML approaches and classifies them according to the introduced definitions.

        "abstract": "This paper presents an original method for studying the performance of the supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods, the A-Test method. The method offers the possibility of investigating the structural risk as well as the learning capacity of ML methods in a quantitating manner. A-Test provides a powerful validation method for the learning methods with small or medium size of the learning data, where overfitting is regarded as a common problem of learning. Such a condition can occur in many applications of bioinformatics and biomedical engineering in which access to a large dataset is a challengeable task. Performance of the A-Test method is explored by validation of two ML methods, using real datasets of heart sound signals. The datasets comprise of children cases with a normal heart condition as well as 4 pathological cases: aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary stenosis. It is observed that the A-Test method provides further comprehensive and more realistic information about the performance of the classification methods as compared to the existing alternatives, the K-fold validation and repeated random sub-sampling.",

        "title": "Predicting nutritional status for women of childbearing age from their economic, health, and demographic features: A supervised machine learning approach",
        "abstract": "Background Malnutrition imposes enormous costs resulting from lost investments in human capital and increased healthcare expenditures. There is a dearth of research focusing on the prediction of womens body mass index (BMI), and the malnutrition outcomes (underweight, overweight and obesity) in developing countries. This paper attempts to fill out this knowledge gap by predicting the BMI and the risks of malnutrition outcomes for Bangladeshi women of childbearing age from their economic, health, and demographic features. Methods Data from the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey and a series of supervised machine learning (SML) techniques are used. Additionally, this study circumvents the imbalanced distribution problem in obesity classification by utilizing an oversampling approach. Results Study findings demonstrate that support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor are the two best-performing methods in BMI prediction based on coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The combined predictor algorithms consistently yield top specificity, Cohens kappa, F1-score, and AUC in classifying the malnutrition status, and their performance is robust to alternative standards. The feature importance ranking based on several nonparametric and combined predictors indicates that socioeconomic status, womens age, and breastfeeding status are the most important features in predicting womens nutritional outcomes. Furthermore, the conditional inference trees corroborate that those three features along with the partners educational attainment and employment significantly predict malnutrition risks. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts BMI and one of the pioneer studies to classify all three malnutrition outcomes for women of childbearing age in Bangladesh, let alone in any lower-middle income country, using SML techniques. Moreover, in the context of Bangladesh, this paper is the first to identify and rank features that are critical in predicting nutritional outcomes using several feature selection algorithms. The estimators from this study predict the outcomes of interest most accurately and efficiently compared to other existing studies in the relevant literature. Therefore, study findings can aid policymakers in designing policy and programmatic approaches to address the double burden of malnutrition among Bangladeshi women, thereby reducing the countrys economic burden.",

        "abstract": "The management and monitoring of diagnostic routines for the active surveillance of colonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria require the use of advanced data drivers based on field sensors that characterize various phases of hospital processes. To this aim, this study describes the proof of concept of an integrated system exploiting smart field sensors and a digital management system that utilizes flow diagrams and business process models and notation (BPMN) to optimize hospital processes. The focus is on the development and validation of the smart field sensor based on a vision system, which extensively leverages machine learning algorithms for real-time identification of hand-washing procedures. The novelty of this research is twofold: hands joints are extracted and processed frame-by-frame to extract relevant geometric features, which are the input of three independent Random Forests. Then, the output of the three Random Forests composes the input for a final supervisor classifier (a simple Artificial Neural Network). The overall system prediction accuracy is of 73.3%, which is an encouraging result given the complexity of such gestures and the simplicity of the algorithms adopted. Therefore, the proposed method demonstrates the capability of field sensors to facilitate novel real-time management models in the healthcare sector, aligning with the principles of the Healthcare 4.0 paradigm.",

        "abstract": "Intrusion detection system is considered as one of the main sources for protection of important information and communication technologies especially in healthcare networks. Intrusion detection system must be updated frequently because of intrusions that improves periodically. Due to particular limitations such as resource-constrained devices, limited memory and battery capacity of nodes, and unique protocol stacks, traditional intrusion detection algorithms must be updated and improved for application to the Internet of Things. To address this issue, a lightweight attack detection approach based on supervised machine learning–based FIDS (Frothy Disturbance Intrusion Detection System) was developed to detect an adversary attempting to inject unneeded data into the network. FIDS can play an important role in intrusion detection. The proposed model was trained with KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Database) dataset using SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm. AODV (Ad-hoc- on-demand Distance Vector) routing protocol was used for routing to make it more energy efficient since the energy usable was limited. The process of packet transmission was done with the help of clustering algorithm to separate the sensors into groups with each group containing a cluster head.  \n ",

        "title": "Learning Curves for Decision Making in Supervised Machine Learning - A Survey",
        "abstract": "Learning curves are a concept from social sciences that has been adopted in the context of machine learning to assess the performance of a learning algorithm with respect to a certain resource, e.g., the number of training examples or the number of training iterations. Learning curves have important applications in several machine learning contexts, most notably in data acquisition, early stopping of model training, and model selection. For instance, learning curves can be used to model the performance of the combination of an algorithm and its hyperparameter configuration, providing insights into their potential suitability at an early stage and often expediting the algorithm selection process. Various learning curve models have been proposed to use learning curves for decision making. Some of these models answer the binary decision question of whether a given algorithm at a certain budget will outperform a certain reference performance, whereas more complex models predict the entire learning curve of an algorithm. We contribute a framework that categorises learning curve approaches using three criteria: the decision-making situation they address, the intrinsic learning curve question they answer and the type of resources they use. We survey papers from the literature and classify them into this framework.",

        "abstract": "New technological innovations are changing the future of healthcare system. Identification of factors that are responsible for causing depression may lead to new experiments and treatments. Because depression as a disease is becoming a leading community health concern worldwide. Using machine learning techniques this article presents a complete methodological framework to process and explore the heterogenous data and to better understand the association between factors related to quality of life and depression. Subsequently, the experimental study is mainly divided into two parts. In the first part, a data consolidation process is presented. The relationship of data is formed and to uniquely identify each relation in data the concept of the Secure Hash Algorithm is adopted. Hashing is used to locate and index the actual items in the data. The second part proposed a model using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. The consolidation approach helped in providing a base for formulation and validation of the research hypothesis. The Self organizing map provided 08 cluster solution and the classification problems were taken from the clustered data to further validate the performance of the posterior probability multi-class Support Vector Machine. The expectations of the importance sampling resulted in factors responsible for causing depression. The proposed model was adopted to improve the classification performance, and the result showed classification accuracy of 91.16%.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global health, necessitating the development of predictive models to manage and mitigate its effects. Early diagnosis is crucial for preventing the progression of diseases that can significantly endanger human life. This study explores the application of supervised machine learning techniques to predict Post-COVID-19 outcomes, including long-term health complications and recovery trajectories. In this study, we utilized 10 advanced supervised machine learning algorithms, including both stand-alone models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian Naive Bayes) and ensemble learning techniques (Bagging Decision Tree Ensemble, Boosting Decision Tree Ensemble, Voting Ensemble, and Stacked Generalization – Stacking Ensemble). These models were applied to analyze and predict the presence of COVID-19 using the COVID-19 Symptoms and Presence dataset from Kaggle. The performance of each model was evaluated using an 80:20 train-test split as well as 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25-fold cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. The results indicate that the Decision Tree algorithm outperformed the other models, achieving an accuracy of 98.81%, a precision of 1.00, a recall of 0.98, and an F1-score of 0.99. Our results indicate that machine learning models can effectively predict Post-COVID-19 conditions, providing valuable insights for healthcare providers and policymakers.",

        "title": "A New Hybrid Model for Mapping Spatial Accessibility to Healthcare Services Using Machine Learning Methods",
        "abstract": "The unequal distribution of healthcare services is the main obstacle to achieving health equity and sustainable development goals. Spatial accessibility to healthcare services is an area of interest for health planners and policymakers. In this study, we focus on the spatial accessibility to four different types of healthcare services, including hospitals, pharmacies, clinics, and medical laboratories at Isfahan’s census blocks level, in a multivariate study. Regarding the nature of spatial accessibility, machine learning unsupervised clustering methods are utilized to analyze the spatial accessibility in the city. Initially, the study area was grouped into five clusters using three unsupervised clustering methods: K-Means, agglomerative, and bisecting K-Means. Then, the intersection of the results of the methods is considered to be conclusive evidence. Finally, using the conclusive evidence, a supervised clustering method, KNN, was applied to generate the map of the spatial accessibility situation in the study area. The findings of this study show that 47%, 22%, and 31% of city blocks in the study area have rich, medium, and poor spatial accessibility, respectively. Additionally, according to the study results, the healthcare services development is structured in a linear pattern along a historical avenue, Chaharbagh. Although the scope of this study was limited in terms of the supply and demand rates, this work gives more information and spatial insights for researchers, planners, and policymakers aiming to improve accessibility to healthcare and sustainable urban development. As a recommendation for further research work, it is suggested that other influencing factors, such as the demand and supply rates, should be integrated into the method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of death and permanent disability, making it a serious global health concern. Cell death is the\nresult of impaired blood flow to the brain. Patient outcomes are ultimately impacted by prompt and precise stroke type\nidentification, which is essential for efficient management and treatment. The potential of machine learning algorithms to\ncategorize stroke subtypes and forecast the probability of stroke occurrence is examined in this project. A thorough dataset that\nincluded clinical features, medical imaging results, and patient demographics was put together. To guarantee compatibility with\nmachine learning algorithms, this dataset was preprocessed, fixing missing values and transforming categorical variables into a\nnumerical format. To find the most pertinent variables for prediction, feature selection was done. Four machine learning\nalgorithms were used: Random Forest (an ensemble learning technique), k-NN (a nearest-neighbor method), J48 (a decision\ntree algorithm), and Naive Bayes. A 10-fold cross-validation technique was used to thoroughly assess the model's performance,\nguaranteeing solid and trustworthy outcomes. The Random Forest algorithm proved to be effective in predicting stroke, as\nevidenced by its highest accuracy. The potential of machine learning to help medical professionals prevent, diagnose, and treat\nstrokes is highlighted by this finding. The knowledge gathered from this research could improve patient care and guide the\ncreation of individualized treatment programs. This project highlights the wider application of machine learning in healthcare\nbeyond stroke. Machine learning has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by utilizing data analysis and predictive\nmodeling, which could result in better patient outcomes, more individualized treatments, and better diagnostics.\n",

        "abstract": "Heart disease is one of the most dangerous and largest killers in the world. Identifying heart disease early has a vast positive effect on patient outcomes and their quality of life. In this research, we try to identify heart disease using machine learning (ML) algorithms. ML algorithms have the highest probability of success if they work on a data set with extensive and diverse information about the given problem - in this case heart disease. There are multiple types of ML algorithms to test, so we can try many different ones on the data, making the results more precise. Even if there are many different algorithms to test, each machine-learning solution can yield different results depending on the dataset used and our target goals. The main goal of this study is to find the differences between individual ML algorithms being used in our specific case: which ML algorithm, or combination of algorithms, is appropriate to detect heart disease with high accuracy? The ML algorithms used in this research are the Naive Bayes Classifier, the Random Forest classifier, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Furthermore, this study generates insights into these ML algorithms – if a particular algorithm’s model performs better than another on the dataset, analyzing this difference can help us understand what makes the model more suitable for diagnostic screening. Changing models’ hyperparameters or their pre-processing techniques allows for a more robust and reliable model that can be readily incorporated into a healthcare environment.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV is no longer pandemic but rather endemic, with more than 651,247 people around world having lost their lives after contracting the disease. Currently, there is no specific treatment or cure for COVID-19, and thus living with the disease and its symptoms is inevitable. This reality has placed a massive burden on limited healthcare systems worldwide especially in the developing nations. Although neither an effective, clinically proven antiviral agents' strategy nor an approved vaccine exist to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic, there are alternatives that may reduce the huge burden on not only limited healthcare systems but also the economic sector; the most promising include harnessing non-clinical techniques such as machine learning, data mining, deep learning and other artificial intelligence. These alternatives would facilitate diagnosis and prognosis for 2019-nCoV pandemic patients. Supervised machine learning models for COVID-19 infection were developed in this work with learning algorithms which include logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, naive Bayes, and artificial neutral network using epidemiology labeled dataset for positive and negative COVID-19 cases of Mexico. The correlation coefficient analysis between various dependent and independent features was carried out to determine a strength relationship between each dependent feature and independent feature of the dataset prior to developing the models. The 80% of the training dataset were used for training the models while the remaining 20% were used for testing the models. The result of the performance evaluation of the models showed that decision tree model has the highest accuracy of 94.99% while the Support Vector Machine Model has the highest sensitivity of 93.34% and Naïve Bayes Model has the highest specificity of 94.30%.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has enabled innovative usage in numerous fields. These systems are vulnerable to hostile assaults. Small intentional alterations to misclassify data constitute a maj or security risk. We examine three solutions: “Self-Supervised Adversarial Defence”, “Adversarial Mixup” and “Secure and Self-Supervised Learning.” These strategies safeguard and protect machine learning models from other computers. We start our study with the theory underlying these approaches and how they are employed in machine learning. A detailed experimental evaluation utilizing a real-world dataset with difficult adversarial situations is shown. These approaches are tested using accuracy, precision, memory, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Results are certain. All indicators suggest that new methods outperform old ones. “Self-Supervised Adversarial defence” is the most exact and precise, but “Adversarial Mixup” and “Secure and Self-Supervised Learning” are also useful, especially for memory. The ROC AUC values also demonstrate that the recommended approaches can distinguish positive and negative classes, which is crucial in binary classification problems. Finally, our work indicates that these strategies can make machine learning models safer and more resilient in harmful conditions. This study reveals how adversarial perturbations and self-supervised learning might solve the crucial challenge of adversarial assaults. These strategies can make machine learning systems safer, which might impact hacking, healthcare, and self-driving systems.",

        "title": "A Novel Diabetes Healthcare Disease Prediction Framework Using Machine Learning Techniques",
        "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic disease that continues to be a significant and global concern since it affects the entire population's health. It is a metabolic disorder that leads to high blood sugar levels and many other problems such as stroke, kidney failure, and heart and nerve problems. Several researchers have attempted to construct an accurate diabetes prediction model over the years. However, this subject still faces significant open research issues due to a lack of appropriate data sets and prediction approaches, which pushes researchers to use big data analytics and machine learning (ML)-based methods. Applying four different machine learning methods, the research tries to overcome the problems and investigate healthcare predictive analytics. The study's primary goal was to see how big data analytics and machine learning-based techniques may be used in diabetes. The examination of the results shows that the suggested ML-based framework may achieve a score of 86. Health experts and other stakeholders are working to develop categorization models that will aid in the prediction of diabetes and the formulation of preventative initiatives. The authors perform a review of the literature on machine models and suggest an intelligent framework for diabetes prediction based on their findings. Machine learning models are critically examined, and an intelligent machine learning-based architecture for diabetes prediction is proposed and evaluated by the authors. In this study, the authors utilize our framework to develop and assess decision tree (DT)-based random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) learning models for diabetes prediction, which are the most widely used techniques in the literature at the time of writing. It is proposed in this study that a unique intelligent diabetes mellitus prediction framework (IDMPF) is developed using machine learning. According to the framework, it was developed after conducting a rigorous review of existing prediction models in the literature and examining their applicability to diabetes. Using the framework, the authors describe the training procedures, model assessment strategies, and issues associated with diabetes prediction, as well as solutions they provide. The findings of this study may be utilized by health professionals, stakeholders, students, and researchers who are involved in diabetes prediction research and development. The proposed work gives 83% accuracy with the minimum error rate.",

The focus of the Veterinary doctor or practitioner is to supervise the overall health and clinical care of the animals. A veterinary doctor is responsible for observing and promoting the well-being of the animal at all phases of the animal's life span. In the inaccessible remote locations of India, access to Veterinary services is difficult. Farmers or livestock owners have to travel long distances from their villages when they require treatment for their animals. This has adversely affected eutherian mammal farming in rural regions that square measure usually set in remote locations. A website to connect Veterinarians with Livestock owners can turn out to be a valuable solution. Farm Animals represent a valuable quality of nutritional products such as dairy products they also are a great resource of the economy for the owners. The production of dairy and other nutritional products is being challenged due to the toxic use of pests and malady infestation resulting in poor productivity. Death of the animals can also be expected in such cases, massive economic losses to livestock owners and the nation. Such issues must be addressed timely before the situation gets out of hand, this is only possible by making Veterinary services available to every part of the nation, be it via online mode or by providing Veterinary practitioners to rural areas. Livestock production in the farm sector acts as an important source of nutrition to India, it provides economic support to many farmers and contributes to the economy of India.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly applied in medical research and in healthcare, gradually improving clinical practice. Among various applications of these novel methods, their usage in the combat against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most crucial areas of interest, as increasing resistance to antibiotics and management of difficult-to-treat multidrug-resistant infections are significant challenges for most countries worldwide, with life-threatening consequences. As antibiotic efficacy and treatment options decrease, the need for implementation of multimodal antibiotic stewardship programs is of utmost importance in order to restrict antibiotic misuse and prevent further aggravation of the AMR problem. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning tools have been successfully used to predict early antibiotic resistance, and thus support clinicians in selecting appropriate therapy. In this paper, we reviewed the existing literature on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in general in conjunction with antimicrobial resistance prediction. This is a narrative review, where we discuss the applications of ML methods in the field of AMR and their value as a complementary tool in the antibiotic stewardship practice, mainly from the clinician’s point of view.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nPast studies examined factors associated with rural practice, but none employed newer machine learning (ML) methods to explore potential predictors. The primary aim of this study was to identify factors related to practice in a rural area. Secondary aims were to capture a more precise understanding of the demographic characteristics of the healthcare professions workforce in Utah (USA) and to assess the viability of ML as a predictive tool.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study incorporated four datasets - the 2017 dental workforce, the 2016 physician workforce, the 2014 nursing workforce and the 2017 pharmacy workforce - collected by the Utah Medical Education Council. Supervised ML techniques were used to identify factors associated with practice location, the outcome variable of interest.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study sample consisted of 11 259 healthcare professionals with an average age of 46.6 years, of which 36.6% were males and 94.5% Caucasian. Four ML methods were applied to assess model performance by comparing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Of the methods used, support vector machine performed the best (accuracy 99.7%, precision 100%, sensitivity 100%, specificity 99.4% and ROC 0.997). The models identified income and rural upbringing as the top factors associated with rural practice.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBy far, income emerged as the most important factor associated with rural practice, suggesting that attractive income offers might help rural communities address health professional shortages. Rural upbringing was the next most important predictive factor, validating and updating earlier research. The performance of the ML algorithms suggests their usefulness as a tool to model other databases for individualized prediction.",

        "title": "Utilizing Machine Learning for Context-Aware Digital Biomarker of Stress in Older Adults",
        "abstract": "Identifying stress in older adults is a crucial field of research in health and well-being. This allows us to take timely preventive measures that can help save lives. That is why a nonobtrusive way of accurate and precise stress detection is necessary. Researchers have proposed many statistical measurements to associate stress with sensor readings from digital biomarkers. With the recent progress of Artificial Intelligence in the healthcare domain, the application of machine learning is showing promising results in stress detection. Still, the viability of machine learning for digital biomarkers of stress is under-explored. In this work, we first investigate the performance of a supervised machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) with manual feature engineering for stress detection with contextual information. The concentration of salivary cortisol was used as the golden standard here. Our framework categorizes stress into No Stress, Low Stress, and High Stress by analyzing digital biomarkers gathered from wearable sensors. We also provide a thorough knowledge of stress in older adults by combining physiological data obtained from wearable sensors with contextual clues from a stress protocol. Our context-aware machine learning model, using sensor fusion, achieved a macroaverage F-1 score of 0.937 and an accuracy of 92.48% in identifying three stress levels. We further extend our work to get rid of the burden of manual feature engineering. We explore Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based feature encoder and cortisol biomarkers to detect stress using contextual information. We provide an in-depth look at the CNN-based feature encoder, which effectively separates useful features from physiological inputs. Both of our proposed frameworks, i.e., Random Forest with engineered features and a Fully Connected Network with CNN-based features validate that the integration of digital biomarkers of stress can provide more insight into the stress response even without any self-reporting or caregiver labels. Our method with sensor fusion shows an accuracy and F-1 score of 83.7797% and 0.7552, respectively, without context and 96.7525% accuracy and 0.9745 F-1 score with context, which also constitutes a 4% increase in accuracy and a 0.4 increase in F-1 score from RF.",

        "title": "A proposed technique for predicting heart disease using machine learning algorithms and an explainable AI method",
        "abstract": "One of the critical issues in medical data analysis is accurately predicting a patient’s risk of heart disease, which is vital for early intervention and reducing mortality rates. Early detection allows for timely treatment and continuous monitoring by healthcare providers, which is essential but often limited by the inability of medical professionals to provide constant patient supervision. Early detection of cardiac problems and continuous patient monitoring by physicians can help reduce death rates. Doctors cannot constantly have contact with patients, and heart disease detection is not always accurate. By offering a more solid foundation for prediction and decision-making based on data provided by healthcare sectors worldwide, machine learning (ML) could help physicians with the prediction and detection of HD. This study aims to use different feature selection strategies to produce an accurate ML algorithm for early heart disease prediction. We have chosen features using chi-square, ANOVA, and mutual information methods. The three feature groups chosen were SF-1, SF-2, and SF-3. The study employed ten machine learning algorithms to determine the most accurate technique and feature subset fit. The classification algorithms used include support vector machines (SVM), XGBoost, bagging, decision trees (DT), and random forests (RF). We evaluated the proposed heart disease prediction technique using a private dataset, a public dataset, and different cross-validation methods. We used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to eliminate inconsistent data and discover the machine learning algorithm that achieves the most accurate heart disease predictions. Healthcare providers might identify early-stage heart disease quickly and cheaply with the proposed method. We have used the most effective ML algorithm to create a mobile app that instantly predicts heart disease based on the input symptoms. The experimental results demonstrated that the XGBoost algorithm performed optimally when applied to the combined datasets and the SF-2 feature subset. It had 97.57% accuracy, 96.61% sensitivity, 90.48% specificity, 95.00% precision, a 92.68% F1 score, and a 98% AUC. We have developed an explainable AI method based on SHAP approaches to understand how the system makes its final predictions.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 turned out to be an infectious and life-threatening viral disease, and its swift and overwhelming spread has become one of the greatest challenges for the world. As yet, no satisfactory vaccine or medication has been developed that could guarantee its mitigation, though several efforts and trials are underway. Countries around the globe are striving to overcome the COVID-19 spread and while they are finding out ways for early detection and timely treatment. In this regard, healthcare experts, researchers and scientists have delved into the investigation of existing as well as new technologies. The situation demands development of a clinical decision support system to equip the medical staff ways to timely detect this disease. The state-of-the-art research inArtificial intelligence (AI), Machine learning (ML) and cloud computing have encouraged healthcare experts to find effective detection schemes. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the role of AI & ML in investigating prediction techniques for the COVID-19. A mathematical model has been formulated to analyze and detect its potential threat. The proposed model is a cloud-based smart detection algorithm using support vector machine (CSDC-SVM) with cross-fold validation testing. The experimental results have achieved an accuracy of 98.4% with 15-fold cross-validation strategy. The comparisonwith similar state-of-the-artmethods reveals that the proposed CSDC-SVM model possesses better accuracy and efficiency. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The global significance of cigarette smoking in public health highlights the necessity of accurately determining individuals’ smoking status for effective healthcare and treatment planning. Previous research’s lack of a prototype for current models poses a significant challenge addressed in this study. This research develops supervised machine learning models using different algorithms; Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XG Boost, Extra Tree, CatBoost, Light GBM, and Ridge. These models aim to classify 55,692 individuals as either smokers or non-smokers based on 27 different health-related features. After data cleaning and feature selection (comprising Recursive Feature Elimination, Univariate Selection, and examination of Feature Importance), some redundant and less important features were eliminated, such as Urine Protein, Hearing, Dental Caries, Tartar, and Serum Creatinine, leaving 17 features. Following optimization, Random Forest emerges as the top performer, achieving 88.03% training accuracy and 83.29% testing accuracy. Integrated into a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen interface, it provides real-time smoking status predictions. This demonstrates machine learning’s potential for precise, automated smoking status identification, benefiting medical assessment. Further research could explore additional health determinants to enhance model accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Stress recognition, particularly using machine learning (ML) with physiological data such as heart rate variability (HRV), holds promise for mental health interventions. However, limited datasets in affective computing and healthcare research can lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding the ML model performance. This study employed supervised learning algorithms to classify stress and relaxation states using HRV measures. To account for limitations associated with small datasets, robust strategies were implemented based on methodological recommendations for ML with a limited dataset, including data segmentation, feature selection, and model evaluation. Our findings highlight that the random forest model achieved the best performance in distinguishing stress from non-stress states. Notably, it showed higher performance in identifying stress from relaxation (F1-score: 86.3%) compared to neutral states (F1-score: 65.8%). Additionally, the model demonstrated generalizability when tested on independent secondary datasets, showcasing its ability to distinguish between stress and relaxation states. While our performance metrics might be lower than some previous studies, this likely reflects our focus on robust methodologies to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of ML models, which are crucial for real-world applications with limited datasets.",

The diagnosis phase in disease detection is usually the most time-consuming task and is prone to most of the errors. Such complications can be effectively handled if the disease detection process is well automated by incorporating effective machine learning algorithms trained with some benchmark datasets. It should also be noted that huge amounts of data that are acquired from Heart Specialization Hospitals are being wasted every year. In this paper, various classification algorithms have been used to train the machine to diagnose heart disease. By a comparative study of various learning models, we have identified the appropriate learning model for the heart disease dataset.

IoT became more popular in recent years due to its vast applications in many fields such as smart cities, agriculture, healthcare, ambient assisted living, animal tracking, etc. Localization of a sensor node refers to knowing a sensor node's geographical location in the IoT network. In this research, we propose a device free indoor localization mechanism based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), a measure of the receiving signal from the sensor nodes, and supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. An experimental test-bed was implanted in a controlled environment to collect RSSI values from the sensor nodes. The RSSI levels were collected by using multiple and published to a remote MQTT server over the Internet. In this research, RSSI values were used to train supervised ML algorithms, Linear Regression (LR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) to estimate the accurate positioning of IoT related localization applications. The error between the actual measured values of the position and the estimated values are compared to validate the system model presented.",

        "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii, a notable drug-resistant bacterium, often induces severe infections in healthcare settings, prompting a deeper exploration of treatment alternatives due to escalating carbapenem resistance. This study meticulously examined clinical, microbiological, and molecular aspects related to in-hospital mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) bloodstream infections (BSI). From 292 isolates, 153 cases were scrutinized, reidentified through MALDI-TOF-MS, and evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility and carbapenemase genes via multiplex PCR. Utilizing supervised machine learning, the study constructed models to predict 14-day and 30-day mortality rates, revealing the Naïve Bayes model's superior specificity (0.75) and area under the curve (AUC; 0.822) for 14-day mortality, and the Random Forest model's impressive recall (0.85) for 30-day mortality. These models delineated 8 and 9 significant features for 14-day and 30-day mortality predictions, respectively, with 'septic shock' as a pivotal variable. Additional variables such as neutropenia with neutropenic days prior to sepsis, mechanical ventilator support, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure were also identified as ranking features. However, empirical antibiotic therapy appropriateness and specific microbiological data had minimal predictive efficacy. This research offers foundational data for assessing mortality risks associated with CRAB BSI and underscores the importance of stringent infection control practices in the wake of the scarcity of new effective antibiotics against resistant strains. The advanced models and insights generated in this study serve as significant resources for managing the repercussions of A. baumannii infections, contributing substantially to the clinical understanding and management of such infections in healthcare environments.",

        "title": "Developing machine learning models to predict multi-class functional outcomes and death three months after stroke in Sweden",
        "abstract": "Globally, stroke is the third-leading cause of mortality and disability combined, and one of the costliest diseases in society. More accurate predictions of stroke outcomes can guide healthcare organizations in allocating appropriate resources to improve care and reduce both the economic and social burden of the disease. We aim to develop and evaluate the performance and explainability of three supervised machine learning models and the traditional multinomial logistic regression (mLR) in predicting functional dependence and death three months after stroke, using routinely-collected data. This prognostic study included adult patients, registered in the Swedish Stroke Registry (Riksstroke) from 2015 to 2020. Riksstroke contains information on stroke care and outcomes among patients treated in hospitals in Sweden. Prognostic factors (features) included demographic characteristics, pre-stroke functional status, cardiovascular risk factors, medications, acute care, stroke type, and severity. The outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale at three months after stroke (a scale of 0–2 indicates independent, 3–5 dependent, and 6 dead). Outcome prediction models included support vector machines, artificial neural networks (ANN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and mLR. The models were trained and evaluated on 75% and 25% of the dataset, respectively. Model predictions were explained using SHAP values. The study included 102,135 patients (85.8% ischemic stroke, 53.3% male, mean age 75.8 years, and median NIHSS of 3). All models demonstrated similar overall accuracy (69%–70%). The ANN and XGBoost models performed significantly better than the mLR in classifying dependence with F1-scores of 0.603 (95% CI; 0.594–0.611) and 0.577 (95% CI; 0.568–0.586), versus 0.544 (95% CI; 0.545–0.563) for the mLR model. The factors that contributed most to the predictions were expectedly similar in the models, based on clinical knowledge. Our ANN and XGBoost models showed a modest improvement in prediction performance and explainability compared to mLR using routinely-collected data. Their improved ability to predict functional dependence may be of particular importance for the planning and organization of acute stroke care and rehabilitation.",

        "title": "A Supervised Machine Learning Approach to Detect the On/Off State in Parkinson’s Disease Using Wearable Based Gait Signals",
        "abstract": "Fluctuations in motor symptoms are mostly observed in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. This characteristic is inevitable, and can affect the quality of life of the patients. However, it is difficult to collect precise data on the fluctuation characteristics using self-reported data from PD patients. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a suitable technology that can detect the medication state, also termed the “On”/“Off” state, automatically using wearable devices; at the same time, this could be used in the home environment. Recently, wearable devices, in combination with powerful machine learning techniques, have shown the potential to be effectively used in critical healthcare applications. In this study, an algorithm is proposed that can detect the medication state automatically using wearable gait signals. A combination of features that include statistical features and spatiotemporal gait features are used as inputs to four different classifiers such as random forest, support vector machine, K nearest neighbour, and Naïve Bayes. In total, 20 PD subjects with definite motor fluctuations have been evaluated by comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm in association with the four aforementioned classifiers. It was found that random forest outperformed the other classifiers with an accuracy of 96.72%, a recall of 97.35%, and a precision of 96.92%.",

        "abstract": "As the volume and complexity of data continue to grow, predictive analytics has emerged as a vital tool for extracting actionable insights from big data, driving decision-making across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. However, selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm for predictive analytics applications is challenging due to differences in algorithmic performance, computational requirements, and scalability, especially in the context of big data. This paper provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of popular machine learning algorithms utilized in predictive analytics, specifically focusing on their effectiveness and feasibility in big data environments.\nThe study categorizes algorithms based on learning types—supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning—and evaluates their performance across multiple dimensions: prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, scalability, and suitability for real-time analytics. Through a detailed analysis of algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and clustering techniques, we assess each method’s strengths and limitations in handling large datasets. Additionally, the study introduces a series of metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score, and training time, as benchmarks for assessing the algorithms’ predictive capabilities and computational viability.\nA hypothetical case study demonstrates the application of these algorithms on a sample big data set, providing insights into their real-world performance across different predictive analytics scenarios. Visual data representations, including comparative tables and performance graphs, offer a clearer perspective on the trade-offs among algorithm choices. The findings highlight that while certain algorithms like random forests and neural networks achieve higher accuracy in prediction tasks, they may also require substantial computational resources, posing limitations for real-time processing in big data applications.\nThis paper concludes with recommendations for selecting machine learning algorithms based on specific predictive analytics objectives, data characteristics, and processing requirements. Furthermore, it discusses the challenges associated with implementing these algorithms in big data contexts and explores potential advancements, such as the integration of deep learning and the use of distributed computing, as promising directions for enhancing predictive analytics performance in future applications.",

        "abstract": "Disease outbreaks pose significant challenges to public health systems, often requiring rapid response strategies to mitigate widespread health and economic impacts. Traditional methods of outbreak prediction and surveillance, while effective, often lack the capacity to process and analyse the vast quantities of heterogeneous data generated in modern healthcare ecosystems. Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential in this domain, leveraging its ability to process large datasets, identify complex patterns, and provide real-time insights. By integrating diverse data sources such as electronic health records (EHRs), social media feeds, climate data, and genomic sequences, ML algorithms can predict disease outbreaks with unprecedented accuracy. Supervised learning models, for instance, have been successfully applied to forecast influenza trends, while unsupervised clustering techniques have been employed to detect anomalies indicative of emerging infectious diseases. Moreover, ML facilitates advanced public health surveillance by automating data processing pipelines, enhancing real-time monitoring capabilities, and enabling resource optimization for outbreak responses. Despite these advances, the adoption of ML in public health surveillance is not without challenges. Issues related to data privacy, ethical considerations, algorithm interpretability, and integration with existing public health infrastructures remain significant hurdles. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating robust data governance frameworks, improved algorithm transparency, and collaborations between technology developers and public health stakeholders. This paper highlights the critical role of ML in transforming public health surveillance, focusing on its application in disease outbreak prediction. It underscores the importance of continued innovation, regulatory support, and ethical considerations in advancing ML-driven solutions for global health security.",

The real challenge is to diagnose patients with more diagnostic accuracy and in a timely manner, followed by prescribing appropriate treatments and keeping prescription errors to a minimum. In developing countries, the domain of healthcare is progressing day by day using different Smart healthcare: emerging technologies like cloud computing, fog computing, and mobile computing.

However, this abundance of information poses a significant challenge for medical professionals, impeding their ability to accurately analyze symptoms and promptly detect diseases. Addressing this issue, supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a promising solution, showcasing superior performance compared to traditional diagnostic methods. This literature review aims to discern patterns in disease diagnosis across various supervised ML models, with a specific focus on predicting fungal infections, diabetes, jaundice, malaria, and heart diseases. The model faces challenges in managing complex disease data, addressing class imbalances, and optimizing feature selection. Disease datasets present complexities in symptom-disease relationships, while imbalances in disease occurrences impact model accuracy. Among the myriad of algorithms explored, particular attention is directed towards the efficacy of Random Forest and Decision Trees. The proposed model aims to develop robust techniques for handling complex disease data, addressing class imbalances, and optimizing feature selection. These objectives target the improvement of disease prediction models, enhancing their accuracy and reliability for practical applications. Through an in-depth analysis of performance indicators, this study intends to contribute valuable insights into enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of healthcare professionals, facilitating early identification of high-risk conditions, and ultimately improving patient outcomes.",

Conventional intrusion detection techniques, although useful in traditional settings, need to be modified and improved to address the particular difficulties, such as devices with limited resources, memory that is restricted, batteries that have limited capacity, and certain protocol stacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight attack detection approach that detects and prevents attackers from trying to introduce unnecessary data into the network by using a supervised machine learning-based FIDS. Our simulation findings show that the suggested FIDS-based classifier performs satisfactorily in terms of classification accuracy and detection time when enhanced with a combination of two or three complex features.",

Every industry uses data analytics, from banking to retail, and the importance of data analytics in healthcare is on the rise.This research mainly seeks to categorize and predict healthcare data using data mining tools and machine learning (supervised) approaches. We need to build a sophisticated model (using machine learning) to filter through all the data in our databases since there is so much of it. The amount of data stored exceeds the speed at which human beings can analyze it. This categorization becomes even more significant since classified healthcare data may help with patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment. The huge, complicated, and varied nature of healthcare data is driving the need for data mining tools for classification and forecasting. Machine learning has emerged as a crucial tool for healthcare researchers to quickly, accurately, and efficiently resolve complex classification problems. Although researchers are aware of the problem, premature birth (PTB) continues to go unaddressed, despite the fact that it is a huge public health concern with far-reaching negative consequences for families and communities. The first goal of implementing a model based on machine learning is to predict cases of TB. Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (RR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are three learner classifiers utilized for this purpose, in addition to Minimum Information Loss (MIL) discretization.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the global medical community has endeavored to provide swift and efficient patient care by leveraging real-time patient databases. However, the efficacy of these systems, particularly wireless body area network (WBAN) sensors, has been undermined by inaccurate and low-performance readings, leading to unnecessary alarm triggers. This study scrutinizes the potential of data dimensionality reduction techniques and machine learning algorithms in augmenting the detection accuracy of cardiac abnormalities in WBAN sensors. Dimensionality reduction was performed using principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and spatial correlation methods. For arrhythmia prediction, Decision Tree and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms were implemented and their performance compared. Numerical simulations and Python code analysis revealed that the application of data reduction techniques significantly improved the reliability and effectiveness of WBAN sensors in handling voluminous datasets. Furthermore, the use of PCA, ICA, and spatial correlation strategies notably reduced WBAN sensor battery energy consumption, data storage needs, computational complexity, and processing time. These pragmatic solutions could potentially empower healthcare practitioners to intervene proactively before patients encounter life-threatening conditions. The results also demonstrated that feature selection effectively eliminated irrelevant attributes from noisy Electrocardiograms (ECGs), thereby enhancing the precision of the analyses.",

The bulk of the initiatives are aimed at classifying illness onset and minimizing cases of maltreatment. As a supervised learning problem, its accuracy is mostly determined by the training data, which is labeled data on actual patients that is highly privacy-sensitive. Privacy leakage can occur at any point in the machine learning lifecycle, from model training through model deployment, and can lead to a membership inference attack, model inversion attack, and reconstruction attack. As a result, safeguarding users' privacy is critical in healthcare issues, but little has been done to satisfy this demand. In this paper, we propose differential privacy-based Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models on breast cancer classification and diabetes prediction. We evaluate the two models using the popular Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, and Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and depict the privacy requirement and model accuracy trade-off.",

In this case, the strategy of analysis involves selection of data, data processing, modeling and real time dangers identification considering both supervised and unsupervised learning. The results reveal that the proposed framework covers high performance indicators such as: accuracy that equals 97.92%, and the level of precision and recall which also equal 90% ROC AUC has reached 0.94. These results demonstrate that the framework can identify and categorise cybersecurity risks in systems of health information on a regular basis. It not only increases threat perception but also makes the system internally valuable for healthcare IT professionals since it contains real-time monitoring and anomaly detection functionality.

The frequency of cardiovascular diseases is increasing in the healthcare industry. This illness most commonly affects people aged 20 to 48. In supervised learning, data mining mainly depends on categorization algorithms. Using various combinations of calculations and algorithms, the information obtained from hospital data analysis is used for early-stage prediction of post-Covid cardiovascular disease. Machine learning is one of the strange inventions that have been widely used in a variety of fields, including the application of medical services to disease prediction. We examined the accuracy of machine learning algorithms that can be used in this study to predict heart disease analyzes and predict overall risk. One of the most current data mining methods is classification. The classification method’s primary goal is to keep the data in the correct class. In this work, classification methods such as Logistic Regression Classifier, Naive-Bayes, and Ensemble Cardiovascular Prediction Classification Algorithm were used (ECVDPCA) and the dataset is taken from Kaggle repository. The goal of this study is to find the most exact classification approach and to improve accuracy in predicting Post-Covid Cardio-Vascular illness. Python was used to get the ideal solution in this case to predict the accuracy of the classifier in which the proposed classifier gave the best accuracy when compared with the other two classifiers i.e., 95",

It associates many risk factors in heart disease and a need of the time to get accurate, reliable, and sensible approaches to make an early diagnosis to achieve prompt man agement of the disease. Data mining is a commonly used technique for processing enormous data in the healthcare domain. Researchers apply several data mining and machine learning techniques to analyse huge complex medical data, helping healthcare professionals to p redict heart disease. This research paper presents various attributes rel ated to heart disease, and the model on basis of supervised learning algorithms as Naïve Bayes, decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, and random forest algorithm. It uses the existing dat aset from the Cleveland database of UCI repository of heart disease patients. The dataset comprises 303 instances and 76 attributes. Of thes e 76 attributes, only 14 attributes are considered for testing, important to substantiate the performance of different algorithms.

        "title": "Detecting Arrhythmia Heart Condition using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms",
        "abstract": "― Arrhythmia is a common heart condition commonly due to irregular heartbeats, which can have serious implications and significant threats on a person's health. The heart can beat excessively quickly, too slowly, or irregularly as a result of disturbances in the electrical impulses that regulate heart contractions, which is known as an arrhythmia. For effective medical intervention it is crucial to detect and diagnose arrhythmia at an early stage. Machine learning algorithms have shown positive results in automating the arrhythmia detection process in recent years. The advantages of using Machine Learning algorithms include accuracy in handling and analyzing complex ECG patterns, early arrhythmia detection, personalized real-time monitoring, reduced human error, efficient big data handling and resource optimization. Machine learning algorithms can provide clinicians with additional information and insights to aid in their decisionmaking process. This can facilitate more informed treatment plans and interventions. In order to achieve accurate detection rates, this research investigates the use of different machine learning algorithms on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. With a primary focus on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, this study compares multiple algorithms in detail, including Random Forest (RF) Classification, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree Classification using the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm. For the automated strategy Random Forest Classifier can predict unexpected sudden cardiac death with an average accuracy of 98.91%. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques in providing valuable assistance to healthcare professionals in diagnosing arrhythmia effectively and leading to more effective treatment approaches. They also contribute to research, innovation and continuous improvement in patient health care.",

A total of nine thousand one hundred and fifty-nine outpatients were used in the research and data attributes were age, gender, cost of outpatient health care sought and number of visits made by the outpatients. Experiment results showed that age and gender of an outpatient were significant factors in the estimation and forecasting of demand for outpatient healthcare services for which the neural network architecture was used in the data training. Cost and Visits were used as primary variables in decision tree construction for the classification and regression decision trees respectively.",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (Al) that allows the machine to learn from data and become more accurate in predicting outcomes without human intervention. The fundamental idea of machine learning is to mimic the way our brain works. In a variety of application domains, including medicine and healthcare, ML techniques have demonstrated strong prediction abilities. This study evaluated and compared several popular supervised machine learning techniques for predicting heart diseases using medical records from the UCI Machine learning repository. The performance of different models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Logistic Regression models, is examined in this paper. The performance of these algorithms was analyzed based on the (Area Under ROC Curve) AUC score. AUC is an evaluation metric that helps us validate our machine learning algorithm how good it is, and the decision is made to implement if the AUC score is more significant than 0.5. The trial result verifies that the Logistic regression algorithm has achieved the highest AUC score of 0.87 compared to other ML algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Smart device has become a powerful tool for people of all ages. However, the elderly population is generally less aware of how such technology provides support and benefits through the variety of its applications: healthcare care, social interaction, entertainment, and more. Such a lack of awareness poses a vulnerability amongst the elderly user group when faced with an adversary attack, as granting sensor data access to the application operator may result in compromising the user's privacy. This paper studies whether user activities and device interaction can be compromised (or predicted) by adversary sensor data. Precisely, we collect built-in sensor data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and touchscreen sensor, and seek to make predictions on the routine activities of the user. We will perform supervised learning on the collected dataset using two textbook classifiers, namely, the Decision Tree (DT) and the $K$-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). Our experiment shows that these simple classifiers can provide reasonable prediction accuracy, indicating the presence of the leak of side information from adversary sensor data. Specifically, the prescribed classifiers achieve a test accuracy of ~ 80% when being trained over the raw data feature.",

        "abstract": "Detecting and predicting any disease is very important in these modern days, why because everyone is busy with their day to day life and no one is caring about their health and no one is following proper food diet and this recklessness leads to several diseases. Among all the diseases heart disease is a very severe disease. And one of the major reasons for heart disease is taking tobacco, drinking alcohol, and inactive in doing exercise, etc. The WHO (world health organization) records, it says that 31 million people lost their lives because of CVD (cardiovascular disease). So, there is a necessity for the prediction of heart disease before it attacks the person. There is a vast amount of data coming from healthcare industries and hospitals but humans like doctors or medical experts are not able to analyze that data so here comes machine learning to analyze that vast amount of data and gives better results. Form the past several year's researchers have found that machine learning works pretty well in analyzing the data so we came up with few machine learning algorithms like artificial neural networks(ANN), Random forest(RF), logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors(KNN), Naive Bayes(NB), Support vector machine(SVM), Decision tree(DT), etc. to predict the heart disease. And in this paper, we got results of various machine learning algorithms and we did the comparison among them.",

        "title": "Securing Electronic Health Records from Insider Threats in Smart City Healthcare Cloud Using Machine Learning Approach",
        "abstract": "In recent years, healthcare in smart cities is considered as significant to create a more resilient and well-informed healthcare ecosystem. The integration of cloud computing in healthcare industry has facilitated the storage and sharing of electronic health records (EHRs), enabling seamless access to medical information. However, this transition to cloud-based systems has introduced new security challenges, particularly the risk of insider threats. Insiders with authorized access to cloud-based EHR systems, such as healthcare professionals and cloud service providers, may exploit vulnerabilities or misuse sensitive patient data, leading to privacy breaches and unauthorized disclosure. This research work presents an innovative approach to securing EHRs from insider threats in the cloud using Gaussian Mixture Model and Classification algorithms. These techniques analyze user behaviour patterns and detect anomalous activities that may indicate insider threats. Here UK hospital electronic patient health record data set is used to conduct the experiments. The proposed approach comprises two key stages. In the initial stage, the unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model is utilized to find the abnormal patterns in the dataset and label each record in the dataset as normal or anomaly. The second stage involves different supervised classification algorithms namely SVM, KNN, DT, NB and RF are used to classify the new instance. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest (RF) achieves high accuracy in detecting insider threats with an accuracy of 99.97%. The findings of this research contribute to the field of healthcare data security by offering an intelligent and proactive solution for mitigating insider threats to cloud-based EHRs in Smart city environments.",

        "abstract": "Within the realm of machine learning, numerous research advancements have enhanced the understanding of data analytics and prediction models. One of the more recent achievements in artificial intelligence is the rise of machine learning in healthcare, aiding in the development of streamlined treatment and diagnosis. Cardiac focus in this paper is due to an interest in how the pandemic restricted extracurriculars and athletics in school, which led to a decrease in physical activity in adolescents. With a decrease in physical activity, the cardiac systems of students might have weakened thus fostering an interest in applying machine learning to cardiac health in adolescents. By using wearable devices and mobile devices to collect data from participants (mainly adolescents), machine learning algorithms can be applied to the data and then analyzed to get information about the cardiac states of adolescents. Cardiac features were measured using the YAMAY Smart Watch wearable device; a variety of supervised machine learning algorithms (KNN, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Trees) were used to predict the expected data with the target data. Overall, after testing each of the supervised machine learning algorithms, Random Forest had the best prediction accuracy of 75.86%. With these results in mind, research focusing on applying supervised machine learning algorithms to detect cardiac events would benefit from using Random Forest.",

        "title": "Detection of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae on the basis of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry by using supervised machine learning approach",
        "abstract": "Background Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is emerging as a significant pathogen causing healthcare-associated infections. Matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF MS) is used by clinical microbiology laboratories to address the need for rapid, cost‐effective and accurate identification of microorganisms. We evaluated application of machine learning methods for differentiation of drug resistant bacteria from susceptible ones directly using the profile spectra of whole cells MALDI-TOF MS in 46 CRKP and 49 CSKP isolates. Methods We developed a two-step strategy for data preprocessing consisting of peak matching and a feature selection step before supervised machine learning analysis. Subsequently, five machine learning algorithms were used for classification. Results Random forest (RF) outperformed other four algorithms. Using RF algorithm, we correctly identified 93% of the CRKP and 100% of the CSKP isolates with an overall classification accuracy rate of 97% when 80 peaks were selected as input features. Conclusions We conclude that CRKPs can be differentiated from CSKPs through RF analysis. We used direct colony method, and only one spectrum for an isolate for analysis, without modification of current protocol. This allows the technique to be easily incorporated into clinical practice in the future.",

        "title": "Assessment of beliefs and attitudes towards benzodiazepines using machine learning based on social media posts: an observational study",
        "abstract": "Background Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed drugs; however, their prolonged use can lead to tolerance, dependence, and other adverse effects. Despite these risks, long-term use remains common, presenting a public health concern. This study aims to explore the beliefs and opinions held by the public regarding benzodiazepines, as understanding these perspectives may provide insights into their usage patterns. Methods We collected public tweets published in English between January 1, 2019, and October 31, 2020, that mentioned benzodiazepines. The content of each tweet and the characteristics of the users were analyzed using a mixed-method approach, including manual analysis and semi-supervised machine learning. Results Over half of the Twitter users highlighted the efficacy of benzodiazepines, with minimal discussion of their side effects. The most active participants in these conversations were patients and their families, with health professionals and institutions being notably absent. Additionally, the drugs most frequently mentioned corresponded with those most commonly prescribed by healthcare professionals. Conclusions Social media platforms offer valuable insights into users’ experiences and opinions regarding medications. Notably, the sentiment towards benzodiazepines is predominantly positive, with users viewing them as effective while rarely mentioning side effects. This analysis underscores the need to educate physicians, patients, and their families about the potential risks associated with benzodiazepine use and to promote clinical guidelines that support the proper management of these medications.

        "title": "A Robust Chronic Kidney Disease Classifier Using Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Clinical support systems are affected by the issue of high variance in terms of chronic disorder prognosis. This uncertainty is one of the principal causes for the demise of large populations around the world suffering from some fatal diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Due to this reason, the diagnosis of this disease is of great concern for healthcare systems. In such a case, machine learning can be used as an effective tool to reduce the randomness in clinical decision making. Conventional methods for the detection of chronic kidney disease are not always accurate because of their high degree of dependency on several sets of biological attributes. Machine learning is the process of training a machine using a vast collection of historical data for the purpose of intelligent classification. This work aims at developing a machine-learning model that can use a publicly available data to forecast the occurrence of chronic kidney disease. A set of data preprocessing steps were performed on this dataset in order to construct a generic model. This set of steps includes the appropriate imputation of missing data points, along with the balancing of data using the SMOTE algorithm and the scaling of the features. A statistical technique, namely, the chi-squared test, is used for the extraction of the least-required set of adequate and highly correlated features to the output. For the model training, a stack of supervised-learning techniques is used for the development of a robust machine-learning model. Out of all the applied learning techniques, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) achieved the lowest false-negative rates and test accuracy, equal to 99.33% and 98.67%, respectively. However, SVM achieved better results than RF did when validated with 10-fold cross-validation.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes is a prevalent and long-lasting medical disorder that has significant consequences for health. It is important to diagnose diabetes promptly and accurately in order to effectively manage it. This study use machine learning algorithms to forecast the occurrence of diabetes by analyzing a dataset obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Important diagnostic characteristics such as the count of pregnancies, insulin levels, age, body mass index (BMI), and other health measurements are used. We utilize various supervised learning classification methods, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbours (k- NN), and Random Forest, in order to create a reliable predictive model. The study entails thorough data preprocessing, meticulous feature selection, and rigorous model training to guarantee the precision and dependability of predictions. Performance indicators, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1- score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), are employed to assess the efficacy of each algorithm. The objective of this research is to enhance the identification and treatment of diabetes at an early stage, hence enhancing the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. This effort aims to enhance predictive modelling in the field of diabetes using advanced machine learning techniques.

        "title": "Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review",
        "abstract": "Background The use of machine learning (ML) in mental health (MH) research is increasing, especially as new, more complex data types become available to analyze. By examining the published literature, this review aims to explore the current applications of ML in MH research, with a particular focus on its use in studying diverse and vulnerable populations, including immigrants, refugees, migrants, and racial and ethnic minorities. Methods From October 2022 to March 2024, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and PubMed were queried. ML-related, MH-related, and population-of-focus search terms were strung together with Boolean operators. Backward reference searching was also conducted. Included peer-reviewed studies reported using a method or application of ML in an MH context and focused on the populations of interest. We did not have date cutoffs. Publications were excluded if they were narrative or did not exclusively focus on a minority population from the respective country. Data including study context, the focus of mental healthcare, sample, data type, type of ML algorithm used, and algorithm performance were extracted from each. Results Ultimately, 13 peer-reviewed publications were included. All the articles were published within the last 6 years, and over half of them studied populations within the US. Most reviewed studies used supervised learning to explain or predict MH outcomes. Some publications used up to 16 models to determine the best predictive power. Almost half of the included publications did not discuss their cross-validation method. Conclusions The included studies provide proof-of-concept for the potential use of ML algorithms to address MH concerns in these special populations, few as they may be. Our review finds that the clinical application of these models for classifying and predicting MH disorders is still under development.

        "abstract": "New technologies like Machine learning and Big data analytics have been proven to provide promising solutions to biomedical communities, healthcare problems, and patient care. They also help in early prediction of disease by accurate interpretation of medical data. Disease management strategies can further be improved by the detection of early signs of disease. This early prediction, moreover, can be helpful in controlling the symptoms of the disease as well as the proper treatment of disease. Machine learning approaches can be used in the prediction of chronic diseases, such as kidney and heart diseases, by developing the classification models. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing extensive approach to predict Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD). The approach involves replacing null values, resampling, standardization, normalization, classification, and prediction. This work aims to predict the risk of CHD using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbours. Also, a comparative study among these algorithms on the basis of prediction accuracy is performed. Further, $K$-fold Cross Validation is used to generate randomness in the data. These algorithms are experimented over “Framingham Heart Study” dataset, which is having 4240 records. In our experimental analysis, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbour achieved an accuracy of 96.8%, 92.7%, and 92.89% respectively. Therefore, by including our preprocessing steps, Random Forest classification gives more accurate results than other machine learning algorithms.",

Getting useful information out of the data which has been examined using diverse perspective and various machine learning methods and grouping the required information is a bit difficult task. When various data mining methods are applied on a huge and accessible data which will definitely provide us with the required information to the users. Pancreatitis contributes to Infection, Kidney failure, Breathing problem, Diabetes, Malnutrition, Pancreatic cancer. So, mining the Pancreatitis data in efficient way is a crucial concern. An outcome feature has to be predicted using a dataset where the outcome may contain only two constants that is either 1 or 0. 0 refers to the sufferer having Acute Pancreatitis and 1 refers to the sufferer may have chronic pancreatitis. Thus, an outcome feature with exemplary accuracy has to be predicted using the test dataset and classification algorithms. In order to realize this data is very necessary and then diverse classification techniques can be experimented. Then a finest model can be preferred which gives the maximum accuracy among all others.",

        "abstract": "Drug–drug interactions (DDI) are a critical concern in healthcare due to their potential to cause adverse effects and compromise patient safety. Supervised machine learning models for DDI prediction need to be optimized to learn abstract, transferable features, and generalize to larger chemical spaces, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality labeled DDI data. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we present SMR–DDI, a self-supervised framework that leverages contrastive learning to embed drugs into a scaffold-based feature space. Molecular scaffolds represent the core structural motifs that drive pharmacological activities, making them valuable for learning informative representations. Specifically, we pre-trained SMR–DDI on a large-scale unlabeled molecular dataset. We generated augmented views for each molecule via SMILES enumeration and optimized the embedding process through contrastive loss minimization between views. This enables the model to capture relevant and robust molecular features while reducing noise. We then transfer the learned representations for the downstream prediction of DDI. Experiments show that the new feature space has comparable expressivity to state-of-the-art molecular representations and achieved competitive DDI prediction results while training on less data. Additional investigations also revealed that pre-training on more extensive and diverse unlabeled molecular datasets improved the model’s capability to embed molecules more effectively. Our results highlight contrastive learning as a promising approach for DDI prediction that can identify potentially hazardous drug combinations using only structural information.",

Hence, the development of efficient and accurate methods for early diagnosis of heart disease has become a priority in the medical field. In this study, we did a comparative study of exiting supervised machine learning approaches for predicting heart disease diagnosis and also improved the accuracy of KNN by changing K values. We used a dataset that consists of a variety of features such as age, gender and other important indicators for heart disease diagnosis. We then explored and evaluated traditional ML algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and SVM for the predictive analysis. A number of criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score, were used to assess the models' performance. This study provides evidence that ML algorithms can be used to forecast the diagnosis of heart disease. Healthcare providers and medical practitioners can utilize the outcomes of this study for early detection and management of cardiac disease. Further research will aim to analyse and evaluate additional machine learning algorithms to enhance precision and performance.",

        "title": "Prediction of Thyroid Disease using Machine Learning Approaches and Featurewiz Selection",
        "abstract": "Thyroid disease is one of the most disturbing hormonal disorders faced by the global population. To help the healthcare industry to diagnose the disorder rapidly and accurately, supervised machine learning algorithms and feature selection were introduced to play an essential role in predicting whether a patient has developed thyroid disease from his/her various characteristics. Therefore, in this work, a new feature selection library was introduced, which was the Featurewiz in the Python library. The goals were to present the performance of the Featurewiz library and to decide on a remarkable model for thyroid disease prediction among several machine learning models, such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier, and ensembled machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boost). A data set consisting of records of thyroid patients in Australia was used to develop the machine-learning models. After the data set was cleaned, exploratory data analysis was carried out. The models were then built in two ways: without feature selection and with feature selection. The feature selection process was conducted by using a new Python library called Featurewiz. The performances of the models from the two operations were evaluated using three performance metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under Curve) value from ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve). From the two operations, the results are similar in the way that tree-based models, especially those formed by the ensemble method, outperform the statistical models. Initially, in the process without feature selection, the champion model is XGBoost with 99.23% accuracy, while Random Forest ranks second with 98.79% accuracy. However, after the feature selection, the result reveals that the champion model is Random Forest. This model achieves an improvement of 0.66% in accuracy (99.45%), making it the best model from both operations. The model also scores 0.99 and 0.97 in F1-score and AUC values, respectively. The valuable insights gained from this study can serve as a comprehensive framework for machine learning applications in predicting thyroid illness. Additionally, the study highlights the advantageous utilization of the Python feature selection library, Featurewiz. With the combination of Featurewiz and machine learning applications, medical authorities can save time and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis when identifying patients with thyroid disease.",

        "title": "IOT-Based Medical Informatics Farming System with Predictive Data Analytics Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms",
        "abstract": "In the farming industry, the Internet of Things (IoT) is crucial for boosting utility. Innovative agriculture practices and medical informatics have the potential to increase crop yield while using the same amount of input. Individuals can benefit from the Internet of Things in various ways. The intelligent farms require the creation of an IoT-based infrastructure based on sensors, actuators, embedded systems, and a network connection. The agriculture sector will gain new advantages from machine learning and IoT data analytics in terms of improving crop output quantity and quality to fulfill rising food demand. This paper described an intelligent medical informatics farming system with predictive data analytics on sensing parameters, utilizing a supervised machine learning approach in an intelligent agricultural system. The four essential components of the proposed approach are the cloud layer, fog layer, edge layer, and sensor layer. The primary goal is to enhance production and provide organic farming by adjusting farming conditions as per plant needs that are considered in experimentation. The use of machine learning on acquired sensor data from a prototype embedded model is investigated for regulating the actuators in the system. Then, an analytics and decision-making system was built at the fog layer, employing two supervised machine learning approaches including classification and regression algorithms using a support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for effective computation over the cloud layer. The experimental results are evaluated and analyzed in MATLAB software, and it is found that the classification accuracy using SVM is much better as compared to ANN and other state of art methods.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become increasingly valuable in various civil/military applications like industrial process control, civil engineering applications such as buildings structural strength monitoring, environmental monitoring, border intrusion, IoT (Internet of Things), and healthcare. However, the sensed data generated by WSNs is often noisy and unreliable, making it a challenge to detect and diagnose anomalies. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used to address this problem by detecting and identifying unusual patterns in the sensed data. This survey paper provides an overview of the state of the art applications of ML techniques for data anomaly detection in WSN domains. We first introduce the characteristics of WSNs and the challenges of anomaly detection in WSNs. Then, we review various ML techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning that have been applied to WSN data anomaly detection. We also compare different ML-based approaches and their performance evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss open research challenges and future directions for applying ML techniques in WSNs sensed data anomaly detection.",

        "title": "A Supervised Machine Learning Approach using Different Feature Selection Techniques on Voice Datasets for Prediction of Parkinson’s Disease",
        "abstract": "Among the neurological diseases, parkinson’s disease is the second most common disease, which affect the old age people over the age of 65 year. It is also mentioned that the number of people affected with Parkinson’s disease will increase at a higher rate until 2050, and it will be a rising concern to many developed countries because the cost due to the healthcare service of these disease is really high. Parkinson’s disease (PD) belongs to the group of neurological disorder, which directly affect the brain cells and the effect is shown in terms of movement, voice and other cognitive disabilities. Past few years researchers are working for detection and monitoring of the Parkinson’s disease by using the speech analysis as well as the gait analysis data. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques are gaining popularity because these techniques are able to automate the pattern recognition process with high accuracy.However so far, no body has compared the performance metrics using different feature sets by applying nonlinear and linear classification approaches based on the voice data. So, in this paper we have proposed a new approach by comparing the performance metrics with different feature sets such as genetic algorithm-based feature sets as well as Principal Component Analysis based feature reduction technique for selecting the feature sets. We have used different classification approaches to compare the performance metrics. We have found an accuracy of 97.57% using SVM with RBF by using genetic algorithm-based feature sets. This analysis will help the clinicians to differentiate the PD group from healthy group based on the voice data.",

        "title": "Machine Learning Modeling of Disease Treatment Default: A Comparative Analysis of Classification Models",
        "abstract": "Generally, treatment default of diseases by patients is regarded as the biggest threat to favourable disease treatment outcomes. It is seen as the reason for the resurgence of infectious diseases including tuberculosis in some developing countries. Sadly, its occurrence in chronic disease management is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Many reasons have been adduced for this phenomenon. Exploration of treatment default using biographic and behavioral metrics collected from patients and healthcare providers remains a challenge. The focus on contextual nonbiomedical measurements using a supervised machine learning modeling technique is aimed at creating an understanding of the reasons why treatment default occurs, including identifying important contextual parameters that contribute to treatment default. The predicted accuracy scores of four supervised machine learning algorithms, namely, gradient boosting, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine were 0.87, 0.90, 0.81, and 0.77, respectively. Additionally, performance indicators such as the positive predicted value score for the four models ranged between 98.72%–98.87%, and the negative predicted values of gradient boosting, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine were 50%, 75%, 22.22%, and 50%, respectively. Logistic regression appears to have the highest negative-predicted value score of 75%, with the smallest error margin of 25% and the highest accuracy score of 0.90, and the random forest had the lowest negative predicted value score of 22.22%, registering the highest error margin of 77.78%. By performing a chi-square correlation statistic test of variable independence, this study suggests that age, presence of comorbidities, concern for long queuing/waiting time at treatment facilities, availability of qualified clinicians, and the patient’s nutritional state whether on a controlled diet or not are likely to affect their adherence to disease treatment and could result in an increased risk of default.",

        "abstract": "—Since the advent of COVID-19, healthcare and IT cybersecurity have been an issue. Digital services and foreign labor have increased cyberattacks. July 2021 saw 260,642 phishing emails. 94% of 12 countries’ employees experienced epidemic cyberattacks. Phishing attacks steal sensitive data from spam emails or legitimate websites for profit. Phishing spam uses URL, domain, page, and content variables. Simple machine-learning methods stop phishing emails. This study discusses phishing emails and patient data and healthcare employee accounts cybersecurity. This paper covers COVID-19 email and phishing detection. This article examines the message's URL, subject, email, and links. Uclassify classifies content, spam, and languages and automates emails. Semi-supervised machine learning dominates healthcare. The Uclassify algorithm used multinomial Naive Bayesian classifiers. Document class is [0–1]. This article compared Multinomial Naive Bayesian in two experiments with other algorithms. Experiment 1 achieved an MNB accuracy of 96% based on a database from Kaggle Phishing. Experiment 2 showed that the Multinomial Naive Bayesian system accurately predicted URL and hyperlink targets based on PhishTank data. 96.67% of respondents correctly identified URLs, and 91.6% did so for hyperlinks. These two experiments focused on Tokenization, Lemmatization, and Feature Extraction (FE) and contained an internal feature set (IFS) and an external feature set (EFS). MNB is more exact than earlier methods since it uses decimal digits and word frequency. MNB only takes binary inputs. MNB can detect phishing and spoofing.",

        "abstract": "Objective\nAnaphylaxis is a severe life-threatening allergic reaction, and its accurate identification in healthcare databases can harness the potential of \"Big Data\" for healthcare or public health purposes.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study used claims data obtained between October 1, 2015 and February 28, 2019 from the CMS database to examine the utility of machine learning in identifying incident anaphylaxis cases. We created a feature selection pipeline to identify critical features between different datasets. Then a variety of unsupervised and supervised methods were used (eg, Sammon mapping and eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to train models on datasets of differing data quality, which reflects the varying availability and potential rarity of ground truth data in medical databases.\n\n\nResults\nResulting machine learning model accuracies ranged between 47.7% and 94.4% when tested on ground truth data. Finally, we found new features to help experts enhance existing case-finding algorithms.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDeveloping precise algorithms to detect medical outcomes in claims can be a laborious and expensive process, particularly for conditions presented and coded diversely. We found it beneficial to filter out highly potent codes used for data curation to identify underlying patterns and features. To improve rule-based algorithms where necessary, researchers could use model explainers to determine noteworthy features, which could then be shared with experts and included in the algorithm.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur work suggests machine learning models can perform at similar levels as a previously published expert case-finding algorithm, while also having the potential to improve performance or streamline algorithm construction processes by identifying new relevant features for algorithm construction.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is a result of the availability and accessibility of a massive amount of data collected via sensors and the internet. The concept of machine learning demonstrates and spreads the fact that computers can improve themselves. Deep learning is causing a paradigm shift in medical image analysis. A medical image is a visual representation of the interior of a body, typically used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Researchers and policymakers interested in healthcare outcomes should read this; this research provides an overview of machine learning at a high level. Computer vision is the field of using computer algorithms to understand and analyze visual data, and machine learning is a key tool for developing these algorithms. This review discovered that there are three varieties of machine learning strategies: supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised, and they seem to be gaining traction in risk assessment, disease prognosis, and image-based diagnosis, with increasing success. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), k-means clustering, random forests, transductive learning, and support vector machines are among the most commonly used algorithms. Image analysis using CNN is the most effective method for medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "Majority of medical misfortunes are a result of inaccurate diagnosis. Medical professionals may find difficulty to effectively diagnose diseases and assess symptoms at an early stage due to the lack of time with the patients and the lack of resources to recognize huge amounts of data on time. Machine learning (ML) can help in analyzing large datasets and identify patterns that are usually not visible to human eyes. It reduces cost and repetitive tasks to provide a more personalized diagnosis. In this paper., supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms have demonstrated potential in surpassing current disease diagnosis techniques and supporting healthcare workers in the early identification of high-risk conditions. The proposed system evaluates the user-provided symptoms as input and outputs the likelihood of the condition. It implements different machine learning models to evaluate their performance on predicting diseases. In addition., algorithms like the decision tree algorithm., Naive Bayes algorithm etc. is also done to determine the best ML algorithm forthe prediction of diseases.",

        "abstract": "New technologies are transforming medicine, and this revolution starts with data. Usually, health services within public healthcare systems are accessed through a booking centre managed by local health authorities and controlled by the regional government. In this perspective, structuring e-health data through a Knowledge Graph (KG) approach can provide a feasible method to quickly and simply organize data and/or retrieve new information. Starting from raw health bookings data from the public healthcare system in Italy, a KG method is presented to support e-health services through the extraction of medical knowledge and novel insights. By exploiting graph embedding which arranges the various attributes of the entities into the same vector space, we are able to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to the embedded vectors. The findings suggest that KGs could be used to assess patients' medical booking patterns, either from unsupervised or supervised ML. In particular, the former can determine possible presence of hidden groups of entities that is not immediately available through the original legacy dataset structure. The latter, although the performance of the used algorithms is not very high, shows encouraging results in predicting a patient's likelihood to undergo a particular medical visit within a year. However, many technological advances remain to be made, especially in graph database technologies and graph embedding algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Every day, many individuals encounter different illnesses. The prognosis of a disease is the most pivotal part of treatment. Enormous increase in healthcare and medical data enabled accurate medical data analysis, which aids in early sickness discovery and beforehand patient care. This study focuses on performing research on the enormous medical data by exercising numerous supervised classification algorithms like Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K- Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest to anticipate the most probable disease grounded on the symptoms and also to directly prognosticate the possibility of whether or not the person might be suffering from that particular illness. Based on the symptoms, the model uses the results of the supervised classification algorithms and gives a final validation indicating the disease that the existent might be suffering. On combining the prognostications from all the below classification algorithms, the model returns a more accurate verification when compared to the prognostications made by individual models. This study enhances the swiftness of decision-making and can reduce the rate of false cons. It helps healthcare associations make better decisions about how to proceed with early patient care. It also aids healthcare professionals in developing further effective ways of treating patients.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis disease, also known as coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major reason to increase the mortality rate around the world. Indeed, there is a lack of improvement in the early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Thus, doctors need a trustworthy system to minimize diagnostic errors and to avoid critically surgeries. This contribution is articulated around a Medical Decision Support System (MDSS) design for atherosclerosis, able to take precautionary steps using the patient's clinical parameters. This MDSS is based on supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. We use Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict patients with or without atherosclerosis disease in an established database. The system is validated on Cleveland heart disease, Hungarian, Switzerland, and Long Beach VA databases. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity and specificity as well-known similarity measures. Our system outperforms currently similar published research.",

        "abstract": "Software defect prediction (SDP) in the initial period of the software development life cycle (SDLC) remains a critical and important assignment. SDP is essentially studied during few last decades as it leads to assure the quality of software systems. The quick forecast of defective or imperfect artifacts in software development may serve the development team to use the existing assets competently and more effectively to provide extraordinary software products in the given or narrow time. Previously, several canvassers have industrialized models for defect prediction utilizing machine learning (ML) and statistical techniques. ML methods are considered as an operative and operational approach to pinpoint the defective modules, in which moving parts through mining concealed patterns amid software metrics (attributes). ML techniques are also utilized by several researchers on healthcare datasets. This study utilizes different ML techniques software defect prediction using seven broadly used datasets. The ML techniques include the multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (J48), radial basis function (RBF), random forest (RF), hidden Markov model (HMM), credal decision tree (CDT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), average one dependency estimator (A1DE), and Naïve Bayes (NB). The performance of each technique is evaluated using different measures, for instance, relative absolute error (RAE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), root relative squared error (RRSE), recall, and accuracy. The inclusive outcome shows the best performance of RF with 88.32% average accuracy and 2.96 rank value, second-best performance is achieved by SVM with 87.99% average accuracy and 3.83 rank values. Moreover, CDT also shows 87.88% average accuracy and 3.62 rank values, placed on the third position. The comprehensive outcomes of research can be utilized as a reference point for new research in the SDP domain, and therefore, any assertion concerning the enhancement in prediction over any new technique or model can be benchmarked and proved.",

This article describes the design and deployment of a novel machine learning algorithm, Structural Machine Learning (SML), that combines memetic grammar-guided program synthesis with self-supervised learning in order to learn effectively from small data sets while remaining relatively resistant to overfitting. SML is used to construct a signal processing pipeline for audio time-series, which then serves as the diagnostic mechanism for a wide-spectrum, infrasound-to-ultrasound e-stethoscope. In blind trials supervised by a third party, SML is shown to be superior to Deep Learning approaches in terms of the area under the ROC curve, while allowing for transparent interpretation of the decision-making process.",

ML consists of supervised and unsupervised techniques. Due to the availability of data in abundance, supervised ML has been the most preferred method in the field of data mining. In this research paper, a publicly available dataset for diabetes detection is tested to understand the efficiency of classification of a number of supervised ML algorithms to find the most accurate model. The dataset consisted of data of 768 persons out of which 500 were control and 268 were patients we found that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the other 6 classification algorithm. In the first iteration, the Random Forest algorithm reached 78.44% accuracy. The tweaks performed in the paper outclassed the original random forest algorithm with a difference of 1.08% reaching a score of 79.52%. Further, iteration I gave 171 whilst iteration II gave 173 correct predictions out of the total 218 test data.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a type of developmental disorder that can have notable effects on a person’s cognitive abilities, language skills, ability to recognize objects, social interactions, and communication skills. The primary etiology of this condition is attributed to genetics, and prompt detection and intervention may mitigate the potential for the individual to face exorbitant healthcare expenses and protracted diagnostic procedures. A machine learning (ML) and deep learning architecture was developed with the capability to effectively analyze datasets of autistic toddlers, accurately classifying and identifying ASD traits. To explore the feasibility of predicting and analyzing ASD characteristics across various age cohorts, we employed multiple supervised ML models, namely support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors algorithm, and decision tree, and deep learning models, such as long short-term memory (LSTM). In this study, we analyzed the ASD screening dataset of toddlers from Saudi Arabia. The ASD screening datasets of toddlers from Kaggle were used to test these models. The first dataset includes 1054 instances and 19 toddler-related features, while the remaining datasets consist of 16 features, 507 instances, 165 normal, and 141 ASD cases. We report baseline results of behavior classification using ML and DL approaches. The SVM approach achieved 100% accuracy, whereas the LSTM approach attained 100% accuracy in terms of the accuracy metric. The developed system demonstrates the efficacy of the ASD system in detecting ASD toddlers in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the ASD system has the potential to assist parents in examining their children at an early stage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Diseases tracing plays important role in daily life. Every one cares about their own health. According to some social study, lot of people spends their time on online searching of health related issues. By browsing they get lot of information about the medical concepts and health related issues. Normally, people use Google to search their queries and that search engine respond them with the answer but that answer is in scattered format. User does not gets the exact answer for their queries. From previous work there has been vital work on the information needs of health seekers in terms of questions and then select those that ask for possible disease of their manifested symptoms for further analytic. To resolve such issues an extensive experiment on a real-world dataset labelled by online doctor’s show the significant performance. In this paper, we discussed the techniques for further restructuring of the question and answer has been done in order to get the exact answer of query. A tag mining framework for health seekers will be proposed; aim to identify discriminant features for each specific disease. In this paper we are going to use one of the most famous algorithm of machine learning that is decision tree. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. Surprisingly, it works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables. In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based on most significant attributes/ independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible.

        "abstract": "heart disease or cardiovascular disease includes several circumstances that affect the heart and is one among major reason of putting to demise globally. Here, we employ Machine Learning to predict cardiovascular disease using a data set containing 14 components. Computers are taught to learn knowledge on their own using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence. Machine learning in healthcare is increasingly being used and helps victims and clinicians in a variety of ways. The automated identification and diagnosis system’s performance is comparable to that of a skilled radiologist. This article presents multiple heart disease-related characteristics, and includes models constructed using supervised learning techniques such as the Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. It also focuses on which patients, given certain medical characteristics, are more likely to suffer cardiovascular-disease.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming vital in laboratory medicine and the broader context of healthcare. In this review article, we summarized the development of ML models and how they contribute to clinical laboratory workflow and improve patient outcomes. The process of ML model development involves data collection, data cleansing, feature engineering, model development, and optimization. These models, once finalized, are subjected to thorough performance assessments and validations. Recently, due to the complexity inherent in model development, automated ML tools were also introduced to streamline the process, enabling non-experts to create models. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) use ML techniques on large datasets to aid healthcare professionals in test result interpretation. They are revolutionizing laboratory medicine, enabling labs to work more efficiently with less human supervision across pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical phases. Despite contributions of the ML tools at all analytical phases, their integration presents challenges like potential model uncertainties, black-box algorithms, and deskilling of professionals. Additionally, acquiring diverse datasets is hard, and models’ complexity can limit clinical use. In conclusion, ML-based CDSS in healthcare can greatly enhance clinical decision-making. However, successful adoption demands collaboration among professionals and stakeholders, utilizing hybrid intelligence, external validation, and performance assessments.",

        "title": "Diabetes prediction using machine learning and explainable AI techniques",
        "abstract": "Abstract Globally, diabetes affects 537 million people, making it the deadliest and the most common non‐communicable disease. Many factors can cause a person to get affected by diabetes, like excessive body weight, abnormal cholesterol level, family history, physical inactivity, bad food habit etc. Increased urination is one of the most common symptoms of this disease. People with diabetes for a long time can get several complications like heart disorder, kidney disease, nerve damage, diabetic retinopathy etc. But its risk can be reduced if it is predicted early. In this paper, an automatic diabetes prediction system has been developed using a private dataset of female patients in Bangladesh and various machine learning techniques. The authors used the Pima Indian diabetes dataset and collected additional samples from 203 individuals from a local textile factory in Bangladesh. Feature selection algorithm mutual information has been applied in this work. A semi‐supervised model with extreme gradient boosting has been utilized to predict the insulin features of the private dataset. SMOTE and ADASYN approaches have been employed to manage the class imbalance problem. The authors used machine learning classification methods, that is, decision tree, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and various ensemble techniques, to determine which algorithm produces the best prediction results. After training on and testing all the classification models, the proposed system provided the best result in the XGBoost classifier with the ADASYN approach with 81% accuracy, 0.81 F1 coefficient and AUC of 0.84. Furthermore, the domain adaptation method has been implemented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed system. The explainable AI approach with LIME and SHAP frameworks is implemented to understand how the model predicts the final results. Finally, a website framework and an Android smartphone application have been developed to input various features and predict diabetes instantaneously. The private dataset of female Bangladeshi patients and programming codes are available at the following link: https://github.com/tansin-nabil/Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.",

        "title": "The Diagnosis of Dengue in Patients Presenting With Acute Febrile Illness Using Supervised Machine Learning and Impact of Seasonality",
        "abstract": "Background Symptomatic dengue infection can result in a life-threatening shock syndrome and timely diagnosis is essential. Point-of-care tests for non-structural protein 1 and IgM are used widely but performance can be limited. We developed a supervised machine learning model to predict whether patients with acute febrile illnesses had a diagnosis of dengue or other febrile illnesses (OFI). The impact of seasonality on model performance over time was examined. Methods We analysed data from a prospective observational clinical study in Vietnam. Enrolled patients presented with an acute febrile illness of <72 h duration. A gradient boosting model (XGBoost) was used to predict final diagnosis using age, sex, haematocrit, platelet, white cell, and lymphocyte count collected on enrolment. Data was randomly split 80/20% into a training and hold-out set, respectively, with the latter not used in model development. Cross-validation and hold out set testing was used, with performance over time evaluated through a rolling window approach. Results We included 8,100 patients recruited between 16th October 2010 and 10th December 2014. In total 2,240 (27.7%) patients were diagnosed with dengue infection. The optimised model from training data had an overall median area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.86 (interquartile range 0.84–0.86), specificity of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.56, positive predictive value of 0.73, negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.84, and Brier score of 0.13 in predicting the final diagnosis, with similar performances in hold-out set testing (AUROC of 0.86). Model performances varied significantly over time as a function of seasonality and other factors. Incorporation of a dynamic threshold which continuously learns from recent cases resulted in a more consistent performance throughout the year (NPV >90%). Conclusion Supervised machine learning models are able to discriminate between dengue and OFI diagnoses in patients presenting with an early undifferentiated febrile illness. These models could be of clinical utility in supporting healthcare decision-making and provide passive surveillance across dengue endemic regions. Effects of seasonality and changing disease prevalence must however be taken into account—this is of significant importance given unpredictable effects of human-induced climate change and the impact on health.",

        "abstract": "Learning from patient safety incident reports is a vital part of improving healthcare. However, the volume of reports and their largely free-text nature poses a major analytic challenge. The objective of this study was to test the capability of autonomous classifying of free text within patient safety incident reports to determine incident type and the severity of harm outcome. Primary care patient safety incident reports (n=31333) previously expert-categorised by clinicians (training data) were processed using J48, SVM and Naïve Bayes. The SVM classifier was the highest scoring classifier for incident type (AUROC, 0.891) and severity of harm (AUROC, 0.708). Incident reports containing deaths were most easily classified, correctly identifying 72.82% of reports. In conclusion, supervised ML can be used to classify patient safety incident report categories. The severity classifier, whilst not accurate enough to replace manual processing, could provide a valuable screening tool for this critical aspect of patient safety.",

        "title": "Short-term local predictions of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom using dynamic supervised machine learning algorithms",
        "abstract": "Short-term prediction of COVID-19 epidemics is crucial to decision making. We aimed to develop supervised machine-learning algorithms on multiple digital metrics including symptom search trends, population mobility, and vaccination coverage to predict local-level COVID-19 growth rates in the UK. Using dynamic supervised machine-learning algorithms based on log-linear regression, we explored optimal models for 1-week, 2-week, and 3-week ahead prediction of COVID-19 growth rate at lower tier local authority level over time. Model performance was assessed by calculating mean squared error (MSE) of prospective prediction, and naïve model and fixed-predictors model were used as reference models. We assessed real-time model performance for eight five-weeks-apart checkpoints between 1st March and 14th November 2021. We developed an online application (COVIDPredLTLA) that visualised the real-time predictions for the present week, and the next one and two weeks. Here we show that the median MSEs of the optimal models for 1-week, 2-week, and 3-week ahead prediction are 0.12 (IQR: 0.08–0.22), 0.29 (0.19–0.38), and 0.37 (0.25–0.47), respectively. Compared with naïve models, the optimal models maintain increased accuracy (reducing MSE by a range of 21–35%), including May–June 2021 when the delta variant spread across the UK. Compared with the fixed-predictors model, the advantage of dynamic models is observed after several iterations of update. With flexible data-driven predictors selection process, our dynamic modelling framework shows promises in predicting short-term changes in COVID-19 cases. The online application (COVIDPredLTLA) could assist decision-making for control measures and planning of healthcare capacity in future epidemic growths. Understanding how COVID-19 case numbers will change in the short term in local contexts is helpful for planning public health measures. Here, using population data on Google searches on COVID-19 symptoms, mobility (i.e., movement of people between locations), and vaccination coverage, we develop statistical methods that forecast changes in COVID-19 case numbers for the next one to three weeks in different local authorities in the UK. We further develop an online application that provides visualisations of these forecasts. We show that our programmes achieve better predictive accuracy compared with two existing models. This highlights the promise of our methods in forecasting future local COVID-19 outbreaks. Wang et al. predict local COVID-19 incidence one to three weeks ahead based on symptom search trends, population mobility, and vaccination coverage. Their dynamic model is more accurate than naïve and fixed-predictor models.",

Understanding the factors influencing patient survival outcomes is crucial.This study conducts a comparative analysis of various supervised machine learning models to predict COVID-19 survivors. The dataset sourced from Kaggle repository containing 373 records; however, only 74 records were selected for analysis due to missing data in several feature variables. The outliers were addressed using the Z-Score method, while missing values were imputed using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE).We partitioned the dataset into two distinct subsets: 80% (59 data points) for training and 20% (15 data points) for testing. Supervised classification models, including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network, were employed. The results indicated that the Random Forest model outperformed the others in predicting COVID-19 survivors, with an accuracy of 0.97±0.06, followed by Naive Bayes with an accuracy of 0.75±0.12. This findings demonstrate that Oxygen levels and Age emerge as strong predictors of COVID-19 severity; thus guiding patient outcomes and healthcare services.",

This research explores a supervised machine learning and deep learning model for the classification of epileptic seizure patients from the Epileptic Seizure dataset of UCI machine learning repository. The dataset has 11,500 instances; every information contains 178 attributes. XGBoost is used for the Machine learning approach and ANN is used for Deep learning approach. The proposed ANN algorithm has the improved accuracy and accurately classified the epileptic seizure class patients. 10-fold cross validation is used for the validation purpose. XGBoost acquires 96.6% test accuracy and ANN acquires 98.26% test accuracy. The proposed Deep Learning approach has out-performed the conventional epileptic seizure classifier algorithms. Additionally, the Deep learning model enhances the performance of epileptic seizure detection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective To assess the methodological quality of studies on prediction models developed using machine learning techniques across all medical specialties. Design Systematic review. Data sources PubMed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019. Eligibility criteria Articles reporting on the development, with or without external validation, of a multivariable prediction model (diagnostic or prognostic) developed using supervised machine learning for individualised predictions. No restrictions applied for study design, data source, or predicted patient related health outcomes. Review methods Methodological quality of the studies was determined and risk of bias evaluated using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). This tool contains 21 signalling questions tailored to identify potential biases in four domains. Risk of bias was measured for each domain (participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis) and each study (overall). Results 152 studies were included: 58 (38%) included a diagnostic prediction model and 94 (62%) a prognostic prediction model. PROBAST was applied to 152 developed models and 19 external validations. Of these 171 analyses, 148 (87%, 95% confidence interval 81% to 91%) were rated at high risk of bias. The analysis domain was most frequently rated at high risk of bias. Of the 152 models, 85 (56%, 48% to 64%) were developed with an inadequate number of events per candidate predictor, 62 handled missing data inadequately (41%, 33% to 49%), and 59 assessed overfitting improperly (39%, 31% to 47%). Most models used appropriate data sources to develop (73%, 66% to 79%) and externally validate the machine learning based prediction models (74%, 51% to 88%). Information about blinding of outcome and blinding of predictors was, however, absent in 60 (40%, 32% to 47%) and 79 (52%, 44% to 60%) of the developed models, respectively. Conclusion Most studies on machine learning based prediction models show poor methodological quality and are at high risk of bias. Factors contributing to risk of bias include small study size, poor handling of missing data, and failure to deal with overfitting. Efforts to improve the design, conduct, reporting, and validation of such studies are necessary to boost the application of machine learning based prediction models in clinical practice.

        "title": "Predicting pregnancy loss and its determinants among reproductive-aged women using supervised machine learning algorithms in Sub-Saharan Africa",
        "abstract": "Background Pregnancy loss is a significant public health issue globally, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where maternal health outcomes continue to be a major concern. Despite notable progress in improving maternal health, pregnancy-related complications, including s due to miscarriages, stillbirths, and induced abortions, continue to impact women's health, social wellbeing, and economic stability in the region. This study aims to identify the key predictors of pregnancy loss and develop effective predictive models for pregnancy loss among reproductive-aged women in SSA. Methods We derived the data for this cross-sectional study from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey of Sub-Saharan African countries. Python software was used to process the data, and machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Gaussian were applied. The performance of the predictive models was evaluated using several standard metrics, including the ROC curve, accuracy score, precision, recall, and F-measure. Result The final experimental results indicated that the Random Forest model performed the best in predicting pregnancy loss, achieving an accuracy of 98%, precision of 98%, F-measure of 83%, ROC curve of 94%, and recall of 77%. The Gaussian model had the lowest classification accuracy, with an accuracy of 92.64% compared to the others. Based on SHPY values, unmarried women may be more likely to experience pregnancy loss, particularly in contexts where premarital pregnancies are stigmatized. The use of antenatal care and family planning services can significantly impact the risk of pregnancy loss. Women from lower-income backgrounds may face challenges in accessing prenatal care or safe reproductive health services, leading to higher risks of loss. Additionally, higher levels of education are often correlated with increased awareness of family planning methods and better access to healthcare, which can reduce the likelihood of unintended pregnancy loss. Conclusion The Random Forest machine learning model demonstrates greater predictive power in estimating pregnancy loss risk factors. Machine learning can help facilitate early prediction and intervention for women at high risk of pregnancy loss. Based on these findings, we recommend policy measures aimed at reducing pregnancy loss Sub-Saharan African countries.",

        "title": "Federated Semi-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation via Pseudo-Label Denoising",
        "abstract": "Distributed big data and digital healthcare technologies have great potential to promote medical services, but challenges arise when it comes to learning predictive model from diverse and complex e-health datasets. Federated Learning (FL), as a collaborative machine learning technique, aims to address the challenges by learning a joint predictive model across multi-site clients, especially for distributed medical institutions or hospitals. However, most existing FL methods assume that clients possess fully labeled data for training, which is often not the case in e-health datasets due to high labeling costs or expertise requirement. Therefore, this work proposes a novel and feasible approach to learn a Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) model from distributed medical image domains, where a federated pseudo-labeling strategy for unlabeled clients is developed based on the embedded knowledge learned from labeled clients. This greatly mitigates the annotation deficiency at unlabeled clients and leads to a cost-effective and efficient medical image analysis tool. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method by achieving significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art in both fundus image and prostate MRI segmentation tasks, resulting in the highest Dice scores of 89.23% and 91.95% respectively even with only a few labeled clients participating in model training. This reveals the superiority of our method for practical deployment, ultimately facilitating the wider use of FL in healthcare and leading to better patient outcomes.",

        "title": "A Review of Deep Learning Algorithms and Their Applications in Healthcare",
        "abstract": "Deep learning uses artificial neural networks to recognize patterns and learn from them to make decisions. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the human brain. It uses machine learning methods such as supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised learning strategies to learn automatically in deep architectures and has gained much popularity due to its superior ability to learn from huge amounts of data. It was found that deep learning approaches can be used for big data analysis successfully. Applications include virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri, facial recognition, personalization, natural language processing, autonomous cars, automatic handwriting generation, news aggregation, the colorization of black and white images, the addition of sound to silent films, pixel restoration, and deep dreaming. As a review, this paper aims to categorically cover several widely used deep learning algorithms along with their architectures and their practical applications: backpropagation, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, capsnets, transformer, embeddings from language models, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, and attention in natural language processing. In addition, challenges of deep learning are also presented in this paper, such as AutoML-Zero, neural architecture search, evolutionary deep learning, and others. The pros and cons of these algorithms and their applications in healthcare are explored, alongside the future direction of this domain. This paper presents a review and a checkpoint to systemize the popular algorithms and to encourage further innovation regarding their applications. For new researchers in the field of deep learning, this review can help them to obtain many details about the advantages, disadvantages, applications, and working mechanisms of a number of deep learning algorithms. In addition, we introduce detailed information on how to apply several deep learning algorithms in healthcare, such as in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. By presenting many challenges of deep learning in one section, we hope to increase awareness of these challenges, and how they can be dealt with. This could also motivate researchers to find solutions for these challenges.",

        "title": "Application of machine learning in measurement of ageing and geriatric diseases: a systematic review",
        "abstract": "Background As the ageing population continues to grow in many countries, the prevalence of geriatric diseases is on the rise. In response, healthcare providers are exploring novel methods to enhance the quality of life for the elderly. Over the last decade, there has been a remarkable surge in the use of machine learning in geriatric diseases and care. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of these conditions. Hence, our study aims to find out the present state of research in geriatrics and the application of machine learning methods in this area. Methods This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and focused on healthy ageing in individuals aged 45 and above, with a specific emphasis on the diseases that commonly occur during this process. The study mainly focused on three areas, that are machine learning, the geriatric population, and diseases. Peer-reviewed articles were searched in the PubMed and Scopus databases with inclusion criteria of population above 45 years, must have used machine learning methods, and availability of full text. To assess the quality of the studies, Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) critical appraisal tool was used. Results A total of 70 papers were selected from the 120 identified papers after going through title screening, abstract screening, and reference search. Limited research is available on predicting biological or brain age using deep learning and different supervised machine learning methods. Neurodegenerative disorders were found to be the most researched disease, in which Alzheimer’s disease was focused the most. Among non-communicable diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, kidney diseases, and cardiovascular diseases were included, and other rare diseases like oral health-related diseases and bone diseases were also explored in some papers. In terms of the application of machine learning, risk prediction was the most common approach. Half of the studies have used supervised machine learning algorithms, among which logistic regression, random forest, XG Boost were frequently used methods. These machine learning methods were applied to a variety of datasets including population-based surveys, hospital records, and digitally traced data. Conclusion The review identified a wide range of studies that employed machine learning algorithms to analyse various diseases and datasets. While the application of machine learning in geriatrics and care has been well-explored, there is still room for future development, particularly in validating models across diverse populations and utilizing personalized digital datasets for customized patient-centric care in older populations. Further, we suggest a scope of Machine Learning in generating comparable ageing indices such as successful ageing index.",

        "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) has become an interesting topic in the field of technological research. It is basically interconnecting of devices with each other over the internet. Beside its general use in terms of autonomous cars and smart homes, but some of the best applications of IoT technology in fields of health care monitoring is worth mentioning. The main purpose of this research work is to provide comport services for patients. It can be used to promote basic nursing care by improving the quality of care and patient safety from patient home environment. Rural area of a country lacks behind the proper patient monitoring system. So, remote monitoring and prescribing by sharing medical information in an authenticated manner is very effective for betterment of medical facilities in rural area. We have proposed a healthcare system which can analyze ECG report using supervise machine learning techniques. Analyzing report can be stored in cloud platform which can be further used to prescribe by the experienced medical practitioner. For performance evaluation, ECG data is analyzed using six supervised machine learning algorithms. Data sets are divided into two groups: 75 percent data for training the model and rest 25 percent data for testing. To avoid any kind of anomalies or repetitions, cross validation and random train-test split was used to obtain the result as accurate as possible.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper demonstrated the use of the supervised Machine Learning (ML) for text classification to predict students’ final course grades in a hybrid Advanced Statistics course and exhibited the potential of using ML classified messages to identify students at risk of course failure. We built three classification models with training data of 76,936 posts from two large online forums and applied the models to classify messages into statistics-related and non-statistics-related posts in a private Facebook group. Three ML algorithms were compared in terms of classification effectiveness and congruency with human coding. Students with more messages endorsed by two or more ML algorithms as statistics-related had higher final course grades. Students who failed the course also had significantly fewer messages endorsed by all three ML algorithms than those who passed. Results suggest that ML can be used for identifying students in need of support within the personal learning environment and for quality control of the large-scale educational data.",

        "title": "Metaverse, AR, machine learning & AI in Orthopaedics?",
        "abstract": "The use of metaverse technology in medical education and training has the potential to greatly enhance the way healthcare professionals learn, practice, and deliver care. In particular, the use of virtual reality simulations has shown promise in the field of Orthopaedic surgery. But what exactly is metaverse? The term “metaverse” was coined by science fiction author Neal Stephenson in 1992 to describe a virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet. In the context of healthcare, metaverse technology refers to the use of virtual reality, interactive and other immersive technologies, such as augmented reality in real time, to create simulated environments for training, education, and clinical application. One of the main benefits of using metaverse technology in Orthopaedic education and training is the ability to provide immersive learning experiences that more closely mimic real-life surgical scenarios. For example, a study published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research found that virtual reality simulations were effective in training residents to perform total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The study found that residents who trained using virtual reality simulations had significantly better performance in a simulated TKA task compared to those who did not use simulations. Another study on the use of virtual reality simulation facilitated resident training in total hip arthroplasty (THR). Additional benefit of using metaverse technology in medical education is the ability to use limited resources more efficiently. Training on cadavers and in operating rooms can be costly and time-consuming, whilst simulations using metaverse allow for repeated practices without these constraints. A recent randomised control trial published in the BMJ found that using virtual reality simulations to train surgical trainee on laparoscopic surgery resulted in better proficiency in shorter time compared with traditional training methods. However, there are potential dangers and abuses of metaverse technology in medical settings. For example, there is a risk that students and surgical trainees may not fully understand the limitations of simulations and may have unrealistic expectations for their abilities in real-life surgical scenarios. Some aspects of these issues were highlighted in an earlier publication on the use of virtual reality simulators and training in laparoscopic surgery. This could potentially lead to adverse outcomes for patients. Hence, metaverse in clinical practice is a compliment/ adjunct to, and not a replacement for proper supervised surgical training. There is also the potential for abuse, such as cheating on exams or using simulations to practice procedures without proper supervision. In summary the use of metaverse technology in medical education and surgical training holds great promise for enhancing the way healthcare professionals learn, practice, and deliver care. However, it is important to carefully consider the benefits, drawbacks, potential dangers and abuses of this emerging technology. It is crucial that metaverse technology be used in a responsible, supervised, and ethical manner, in conjunction with formal surgical training, to ensure that healthcare professionals are properly prepared to deliver high-quality patient care.",

        "title": "Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms Using Patient Related Factors to Predict in-Hospital Mortality Following Acute Myeloid Leukemia Therapy",
        "abstract": "Background:\n Despite careful patient selection and improved supportive care over recent years, chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still associated with a significant risk for treatment-related mortality (5-20%), resulting from an interplay of multiple patient and disease-related factors. Tools to better identify candidates suitable for intensive chemotherapy are much needed. In this analysis, using a large administrative database, we evaluate the potential of machine learning (ML) algorithms trained using factors available at the time of admission for AML therapy to predict death during the hospitalization.\n Methods:\n We utilized the State Inpatient Database (SID) for years 2008-2014, which holds one of the largest collections of inpatient discharges incorporating all payers from community hospitals in the United States and is part of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Data from following states was obtained for analysis: Arizona, Florida, New York, Maryland, Washington, and New Jersey. Our cohort included adult (age >17) patients diagnosed with AML (ICD-9 codes 205.XX, 206.XX, and 207.XX) and receipt of any type of chemotherapy on same admission confirmed by ICD-9 diagnosis code (V581, V5811, and V5812) or ICD-9 procedure code of 9925. The primary objective was to predict inpatient mortality in AML patients undergoing chemotherapy using covariates that were present prior to chemotherapy initiation. Features included age, race, emergency room use, year of admission, number of days from admission to chemotherapy, comorbid conditions present at the time of admission, and procedures performed on or before the day of administration of chemotherapy. The main cohort was split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. We compared several supervised machine learning classification algorithms including logistic regression (LR), decision trees (DT) and random forests (RF). Algorithms were trained using 5-fold cross validation with hyperparameters selected via grid search to prevent overfitting. Model performance on the test set was accessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC, ROC). True positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR) and positive predictive value (PPV) were assessed at multiple thresholds. SAS 9.4 and Python libraries were utilized for all analysis.\n Results:\n A total of 29613 subjects with AML were included in final analysis each associated with 4177 features after including indicators to capture missing categorical variables. Median age was 58.9(18-101) years. 13689 (53.7%) were males and 20203 (69%) were Caucasian. Each subject underwent some form of chemotherapy. Mean time from admission to starting chemotherapy was 3 days (95%CI, 2.9-3.1). Among all subjects, 2682 (9.1%) died during the hospitalization following chemotherapy administration. Figure 1 shows the ROC curve comparing all algorithms. Both LR and RF achieved an AUC score of 0.78 while DT achieved 0.70 AUC. In comparison, a baseline LR model with age as the sole predictor yielded 0.62 AUC. Table 1 provides TPR, TNR and PPV for each algorithm at varying decision boundary thresholds.\n Discussion:\n The strength of this machine learning approach is the applicability of using readily-accessible personalized variables to predict inpatient mortality of any patient on track for chemotherapy to treat AML, without incorporating performance status or any laboratory information. Using a threshold of 0.7, our trained RF model achieves TNR of 99.2%, TPR of 8.6 % and PPV of 57.3%. If this threshold is used to select patients suitable for chemotherapy, 51 out of 587 total deaths that occurred in our test set of 5923 could have avoided treatment related mortality while 38 would not have received chemotherapy as they will be falsely flagged. Our study supports the use of supervised machine learning algorithms on large administrative databases to create healthcare solutions. One limitation is that this dataset is not able to differentiate discharges following induction therapy in newly diagnosed patients from those following consolidation. Next steps would be to validate on larger cohorts with more detailed therapy information. Ultimately, estimating inpatient mortality at the time of hospitalization may prove useful in helping clinicians identify high-risk patients for whom alternative treatment options would have better outcomes than chemotherapy.\n \n \n \n No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.\n",

However, Healthcare systems were severely affected by ransomware attacks that may override data or lock systems from caregivers' access. In this work, after obtaining the required approval, we have got a real medical dataset from actual critical care units. For the sake of research, a portion of data was used, transformed, and manifested using laboratory-made payload ransomware and successfully labeled. The detection mechanism adopted supervised machine learning techniques of K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression in contrast with deep learning technique of Artificial Neural Network. The methods of KNN, SVM, and DT successfully detected ransomware's signature with an accuracy of 100%. However, ANN detected the signature with an accuracy of 99.9%.

        "title": "Machine Learning Applications in Studying Mental Health Among Immigrants and Racial and Ethnic Minorities: A Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Background: The use of machine learning (ML) in mental health (MH) research is increasing, especially as new, more complex data types become available to analyze. By systematically examining the published literature, this review aims to uncover potential gaps in the current use of ML to study MH in vulnerable populations of immigrants, refugees, migrants, and racial and ethnic minorities. Methods: In this systematic review, we queried Google Scholar for ML-related terms, MH-related terms, and a population of a focus search term strung together with Boolean operators. Backward reference searching was also conducted. Included peer-reviewed studies reported using a method or application of ML in an MH context and focused on the populations of interest. We did not have date cutoffs. Publications were excluded if they were narrative or did not exclusively focus on a minority population from the respective country. Data including study context, the focus of mental healthcare, sample, data type, type of ML algorithm used, and algorithm performance was extracted from each. Results: Our search strategies resulted in 67,410 listed articles from Google Scholar. Ultimately, 12 were included. All the articles were published within the last 6 years, and half of them studied populations within the US. Most reviewed studies used supervised learning to explain or predict MH outcomes. Some publications used up to 16 models to determine the best predictive power. Almost half of the included publications did not discuss their cross-validation method. Conclusions: The included studies provide proof-of-concept for the potential use of ML algorithms to address MH concerns in these special populations, few as they may be. Our systematic review finds that the clinical application of these models for classifying and predicting MH disorders is still under development.",

        "abstract": "This work introduces a predictive Length of Stay (LOS) framework for lung cancer patients using machine learning (ML) models. The framework proposed to deal with imbalanced datasets for classification-based approaches using electronic healthcare records (EHR). We have utilized supervised ML methods to predict lung cancer inpatients LOS during ICU hospitalization using the MIMIC-III dataset. Random Forest (RF) Model outperformed other models and achieved predicted results during the three framework phases. With clinical significance features selection, over-sampling methods (SMOTE and ADASYN) achieved the highest AUC results (98% with CI 95%: 95.3–100%, and 100% respectively). The combination of Over-sampling and under-sampling achieved the second-highest AUC results (98%, with CI 95%: 95.3–100%, and 97%, CI 95%: 93.7–100% SMOTE-Tomek, and SMOTE-ENN respectively). Under-sampling methods reported the least important AUC results (50%, with CI 95%: 40.2–59.8%) for both (ENN and Tomek- Links). Using ML explainable technique called SHAP, we explained the outcome of the predictive model (RF) with SMOTE class balancing technique to understand the most significant clinical features that contributed to predicting lung cancer LOS with the RF model. Our promising framework allows us to employ ML techniques in-hospital clinical information systems to predict lung cancer admissions into ICU.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) based forecasting mechanisms have proved their significance to anticipate in perioperative outcomes to improve the decision making on the future course of actions. The ML models have long been used in many application domains which needed the identification and prioritization of adverse factors for a threat. Several prediction methods are being popularly used to handle forecasting problems. This study demonstrates the capability of ML models to forecast the number of upcoming patients affected by COVID-19 which is presently considered as a potential threat to mankind. In particular, four standard forecasting models, such as linear regression (LR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine (SVM), and exponential smoothing (ES) have been used in this study to forecast the threatening factors of COVID-19. Three types of predictions are made by each of the models, such as the number of newly infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries in the next 10 days. The results produced by the study proves it a promising mechanism to use these methods for the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results prove that the ES performs best among all the used models followed by LR and LASSO which performs well in forecasting the new confirmed cases, death rate as well as recovery rate, while SVM performs poorly in all the prediction scenarios given the available dataset.",

        "abstract": "The CDC conducts the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) annually, a health-related telephone survey, gathering responses from more than 400,000 Americans since 1984. It focuses on health-related risk behaviors, chronic conditions, and the use of preventive services. In study, we utilized a CSV dataset from Kaggle for the year 2015, containing 253,680 survey responses to the BRFSS2015. The dataset comprises 21 feature variables derived from questions posed to participants or calculated from their responses. The target variable, Diabetes binary, categorizes individuals as having either no diabetes (0) or prediabetes/diabetes (1). The dataset is imbalanced, reflecting real-world distributions of health conditions. We utilized a range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, gradient boosting machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, feed-forward neural networks, and Ada Boost, to predict diabetes status based on the provided features. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices were employed to assess model performance across different algorithms. Through this analysis, our goal is to offer insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques in predicting diabetes and highlight the significance of feature selection and model evaluation in healthcare applications.",

        "abstract": "Background: Multi-parametric MRI provides non-invasive methods for response assessment of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) from non-surgical treatments. However, evaluation of MRI parameters over the whole tumor volume may not reveal the full extent of post-treatment changes as STS tumors are often highly heterogeneous, including cellular tumor, fat, necrosis, and cystic tissue compartments. In this pilot study, we investigate the use of machine-learning approaches to automatically delineate tissue compartments in STS, and use this approach to monitor post-radiotherapy changes. Methods: Eighteen patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma were imaged using multi-parametric MRI; 8/18 received a follow-up imaging study 2–4 weeks after pre-operative radiotherapy. Eight commonly-used supervised machine-learning techniques were optimized for classifying pixels into one of five tissue sub-types using an exhaustive cross-validation approach and expert-defined regions of interest as a gold standard. Final pixel classification was smoothed using a Markov Random Field (MRF) prior distribution on the final machine-learning models. Findings: 5/8 machine-learning techniques demonstrated high median cross-validation accuracies (82.2%, range 80.5–82.5%) with no significant difference between these five methods. One technique was selected (Naïve-Bayes) due to its relatively short training and class-prediction times (median 0.73 and 0.69 ms, respectively on a 3.5 GHz personal machine). When combined with the MRF-prior, this approach was successfully applied in all eight post-radiotherapy imaging studies and provided visualization and quantification of changes to independent STS sub-regions following radiotherapy for heterogeneous response assessment. Interpretation: Supervised machine-learning approaches to tissue classification in multi-parametric MRI of soft-tissue sarcomas provide quantitative evaluation of heterogeneous tissue changes following radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundSupervised machine learning algorithms have been a dominant method in the data mining field. Disease prediction using health data has recently shown a potential application area for these methods. This study ai7ms to identify the key trends among different types of supervised machine learning algorithms, and their performance and usage for disease risk prediction.MethodsIn this study, extensive research efforts were made to identify those studies that applied more than one supervised machine learning algorithm on single disease prediction. Two databases (i.e., Scopus and PubMed) were searched for different types of search items. Thus, we selected 48 articles in total for the comparison among variants supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction.ResultsWe found that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is applied most frequently (in 29 studies) followed by the Naïve Bayes algorithm (in 23 studies). However, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm showed superior accuracy comparatively. Of the 17 studies where it was applied, RF showed the highest accuracy in 9 of them, i.e., 53%. This was followed by SVM which topped in 41% of the studies it was considered.ConclusionThis study provides a wide overview of the relative performance of different variants of supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. This important information of relative performance can be used to aid researchers in the selection of an appropriate supervised machine learning algorithm for their studies.",

        "title": "Classification of patients with cardiac amyloidosis using machine learning models on Italian electronic clinical health records*",
        "abstract": "Amyloidosis refers to a range of medical conditions in which misshapen proteins accumulate in various organs and tissues, forming insoluble fibrils. Cardiac amyloidosis is frequently linked to the buildup of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) or immunoglobulin light chains (AL). Delayed diagnosis, due to lack of disease awareness, results in a poor prognosis, especially in patients with AL amyloidosis. Early identification is therefore a key factor to improve patient outcomes. This study investigates the use of supervised machine-learning algorithms to support clinicians in classifying amyloidosis and control subjects. The aim of this work is to foster model interpretability reporting the most important risk factors in predicting the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. We analyzed electronic health records (EHRs) of 418 participants acquired in a time window of 12 years as part of a case-control study conducted in Fondazione Toscana Gabriele Monasterio (Italy) clinical practice. This work paves the way for the creation of digital health solutions that can aid in amyloidosis screening. The effective handling, analysis, and interpretation of these solutions can have a transformative effect on modern healthcare, offering new opportunities for improved patient care.",

        "abstract": "The Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) is predominately used by the electric utility industry and, consequently, in smart grids. The Peekaboo attack was created to compromise DNP3 traffic, in which a man-in-the-middle on a communication link can capture and drop selected encrypted DNP3 messages by using support vector machine learning algorithms. The communication networks of smart grids are a important part of their infrastructure, so it is of critical importance to keep this communication secure and reliable. The main contribution of this paper is to compare the use of machine learning techniques to classify messages of the same protocol exchanged in encrypted tunnels. The study considers four simulated cases of encrypted DNP3 traffic scenarios and four different supervised machine learning algorithms: Decision tree, nearest-neighbor, support vector machine, and naive Bayes. The results obtained show that it is possible to extend a Peekaboo attack over multiple substations, using a decision tree learning algorithm, and to gather significant information from a system that communicates using encrypted DNP3 traffic.",

        "title": "Combining unsupervised, supervised and rule-based learning: the case of detecting patient allergies in electronic health records",
        "abstract": "Background Data mining of electronic health records (EHRs) has a huge potential for improving clinical decision support and to help healthcare deliver precision medicine. Unfortunately, the rule-based and machine learning-based approaches used for natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare today all struggle with various shortcomings related to performance, efficiency, or transparency. Methods In this paper, we address these issues by presenting a novel method for NLP that implements unsupervised learning of word embeddings, semi-supervised learning for simplified and accelerated clinical vocabulary and concept building, and deterministic rules for fine-grained control of information extraction. The clinical language is automatically learnt, and vocabulary, concepts, and rules supporting a variety of NLP downstream tasks can further be built with only minimal manual feature engineering and tagging required from clinical experts. Together, these steps create an open processing pipeline that gradually refines the data in a transparent way, which greatly improves the interpretable nature of our method. Data transformations are thus made transparent and predictions interpretable, which is imperative for healthcare. The combined method also has other advantages, like potentially being language independent, demanding few domain resources for maintenance, and able to cover misspellings, abbreviations, and acronyms. To test and evaluate the combined method, we have developed a clinical decision support system (CDSS) named Information System for Clinical Concept Searching (ICCS) that implements the method for clinical concept tagging, extraction, and classification. Results In empirical studies the method shows high performance (recall 92.6%, precision 88.8%, F-measure 90.7%), and has demonstrated its value to clinical practice. Here we employ a real-life EHR-derived dataset to evaluate the method’s performance on the task of classification (i.e., detecting patient allergies) against a range of common supervised learning algorithms. The combined method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the alternative methods we evaluate. We also perform a qualitative analysis of common word embedding methods on the task of word similarity to examine their potential for supporting automatic feature engineering for clinical NLP tasks. Conclusions Based on the promising results, we suggest more research should be aimed at exploiting the inherent synergies between unsupervised, supervised, and rule-based paradigms for clinical NLP.",

        "abstract": "Improving the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) management network and building cost-effective and well-managed healthcare systems are high priorities for healthcare units. Creating accurate and explainable mortality prediction models helps identify the most critical risk factors in the patients’ survival/death status and early detect the most in-need patients. This study proposes a highly accurate and efficient machine learning model for predicting ICU mortality status upon discharge using the information available during the first 24 hours of admission. The most important features in mortality prediction are identified, and the effects of changing each feature on the prediction are studied. We used supervised machine learning models and illness severity scoring systems to benchmark the mortality prediction. We also implemented a combination of SHAP, LIME, partial dependence, and individual conditional expectation plots to explain the predictions made by the best-performing model (CatBoost). We proposed E-CatBoost, an optimized and efficient patient mortality prediction model, which can accurately predict the patients’ discharge status using only ten input features. We used eICU-CRD v2.0 to train and validate the models; the dataset contains information on over 200,000 ICU admissions. The patients were divided into twelve disease groups, and models were fitted and tuned for each group. The models’ predictive performance was evaluated using the area under a receiver operating curve (AUROC). The AUROC scores were 0.86 [std:0.02] to 0.92 [std:0.02] for CatBoost and 0.83 [std:0.02] to 0.91 [std:0.03] for E-CatBoost models across the defined disease groups; if measured over the entire patient population, their AUROC scores were 7 to 18 and 2 to 12 percent higher than the baseline models, respectively. Based on SHAP explanations, we found age, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood urine nitrogen, and creatinine level as the most critical cross-disease features in mortality predictions.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has been proven to be a game-changing technology in every domain since the late 20th century. There have been many advancements in healthcare not only for the diagnosis of disease but advanced in the prognosis of the diseases. Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) has progressed a lot in the medical domain in just a couple of decades and played a very important role in exploring human data to understand human body behavior better than ever before, for predicting and classifying all kinds of medical images or videos. A recent and best-used application is detecting COVID-19 by just checking the chest x-ray in a very accurate manner that can be used without human presence and stop the spread of the virus resulting in fewer doctors getting affected. It is known as generative adversarial networks. Some of the types of GANs used for differentiate domains without human supervision and many such mutations of GANs are useful in the health sector. This is simply a quick review of various technologies that will become more in-depth as time goes on.",

        "title": "Supervised Machine Learning Approach for Effective Supplier Classification",
        "abstract": "Supplier assessment plays a critical role in the supply chain management, which involves the flow of goods and services from the initial stage (raw material procurement) to the final stage (delivery). Supplier assessment is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that requires several criteria for the proper assessment of the suppliers. When there are several criteria involved, it makes the supplier assessment process more complicated. For a comprehensive and robust assessment process, we propose the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to classify various suppliers into four categories: excellent, good, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory. In this paper, supervised learning (classification) algorithms are applied for a supplier assessment problem where a model is trained based on the previous historical data and then tested on the new unseen data set. This method will provide an efficient way for supplier assessment that is more effective in terms of accuracy and time when compared to MCDM approach. Classification algorithms such as support vector machines (with linear, polynomial and radial basis kernels), logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and naïve Bayes methods are used to train the model and their performance is assessed against a test data. Finally, the performance measures from all the classification methods are used to assess the best supplier.",

SSL techniques have evolved in response to the poor classification performance of conventional and even modern machine learning (ML) and DL models of enormous unlabeled data produced periodically in different disciplines. However, the literature does not fully address SSL’s practicalities and workabilities necessary for industrial engineering and medicine. Accordingly, this thorough review is administered to identify these prominent possibilities for prediction, focusing on industrial and medical fields. This extensive survey, with its pivotal outcomes, could support industrial engineers and medical personnel in efficiently predicting machinery faults and patients’ ailments without referring to traditional numerical models that require massive computational budgets, time, storage, and effort for data annotation. Additionally, the review’s numerous addressed ideas could encourage industry and healthcare actors to take SSL principles into an agile application to achieve precise maintenance prognostics and illness diagnosis with remarkable levels of accuracy and feasibility, simulating functional human thinking and cognition without compromising prediction efficacy.",

This study explores the application of supervised machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to forecast COVID-19 cases. Utilizing a global dataset of daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases from January 2020 onwards, the research preprocesses the data and trains models to predict trends over a 10-day horizon. Results in- dicate that LR provides consistent and reliable forecasts, estimating an average daily increase of 29,900 confirmed cases globally, while SVM struggles with data fluctuations. These findings highlight the po- tential of ML in enhancing pandemic response strategies, offering actionable insights for healthcare authorities. The study concludes that LR is more suitable for short-term COVID-19 forecasting due to its simplicity and interpretability.",

        "abstract": "Heart disease has been a major public health concern in recent years, excessive alcohol consumption, cigarette, and a sedentary lifestyle are the primary factors, and it is the leading cause of mortality among patients. Medically, heart disease is known for being difficult to forecast, detect, and diagnose. To treat heart diseases, hospitals and other clinics are giving costly therapies and treatments. According to a recent WHO research, heart disease is on the rise. In 2019, 17.9 million people die as a result of this. It becomes more difficult to diagnose as the population grows. As a result, detecting cardiac disease early on will benefit people all across the world, allowing them to receive necessary therapy before it becomes critical. Thanks to recent technical breakthroughs, machine learning has shown to be effective in making decisions and predictions from a big set of data provided by the healthcare sector. In this paper, some of the supervised machine learning techniques used in this prediction of heart disease which are Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GB), Decision tree (DT), Random forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR) on the “UCI Machine learning repository for Statlog (Heart) Data Set” Furthermore, the findings of these algorithms are reported, and a proposal is made to employ the algorithm with the highest accuracy for predicting Heart Disease on a web application. This application will be used as a decision support system by medical practitioners in their clinics as well as people at home.",

However, machine learning (ML) models to predict COVID-19 hospitalization in Asian children are lacking. This study aimed to develop and validate ML models to predict pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization. We collected secondary data with 2200 patients and 65 variables from Malaysian aged 0 to 12 with COVID-19 between 1st February 2020 and 31st March 2022. The sample was partitioned into training, internal, and external validation groups. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed for feature selection, and we trained seven supervised classifiers. Grid Search was used to optimize the hyperparameters of each algorithm. The study analyzed 1988 children and 30 study variables after data were processed. The RFE algorithm selected 12 highly predicted variables for COVID-19 hospitalization, including age, male sex, fever, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, body temperature, chest indrawing, and abnormal breath sounds. With external validation, Adaptive Boosting was the highest-performing classifier (AUROC = 0.95) to predict COVID-19 hospital admission in children. We validated AdaBoost as the best to predict COVID-19 hospitalization among children. This model may assist front-line clinicians in making medical disposition decisions.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) find extensive applications in environmental monitoring, healthcare, and smart cities. Energy efficiency, however, continues to be a significant challenge with the limited lifetime of sensor node batteries. The conventional heuristic-based cluster head (CH) selection techniques tend not to adapt dynamically to network changes, resulting in inefficient energy utilization and decreased network lifetime. This research discusses Machine Learning (ML)-oriented CH selection approaches to improve energy efficiency, network lifetime, and data fusion. Using supervised and unsupervised learning methods, ML algorithms are able to learn optimal CHs dynamically based on residual energy, network structure, and data traffic. The comparative analysis show that ML-based CH selection enhances network stability by 95% and lowers energy consumption by 50% compared to traditional methods. The research points to the promise of ML in WSN performance optimization and opens the doors to intelligent, adaptive clustering technologies.",

There remains several signal processing challenges in this field, which include overcoming the nonlinearities and harmonics that populate the power spectrum. Respiration harmonics distort and overwhelm the measurement of heartbeat due to the large signal amplitude. A supervised machine learning algorithm, the gamma filter, offers an efficient, calibration-free solution to model the time series heartbeat signal given respiration and respiration artifacts. The measured signal is provided by a 5.8-GHz quadrature Doppler radar and a modified electrocardiogram signal is used as the ground truth for training the filter. Experimental results show that the heartbeat is independent and separable from respiration and the algorithm can be implemented in real time.",

        "title": "Bridging Data Gaps: Predicting Sub-national Maternal Mortality Rates in Kenya Using Machine Learning Models",
        "abstract": "Introduction Maternal mortality remains a critical global health issue, with ongoing efforts to reduce its incidence as part of international health priorities. Kenya, a sub-Saharan country that has a disproportionate number of maternal mortality is likely to miss this target unless evidence-based interventions are deployed. The paucity of reliable maternal health data calls for the development of alternative predictive models to complement the impaired civil registration system and the aperiodic national surveys. Methods We utilized DHS surveys from several Sub-Saharan African countries to estimate parameters for predicting Kenya’s maternal mortality rate (MMR) in the absence of recent Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) data. We developed a multiple linear regression model using supervised machine learning using the R-programming suite. Our model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze regional trends and predict sub-national MMR variations. We then applied the model to predict MMR for Kenyan counties using the data for the KDHS 2022 survey. Results Using Pearson’s correlation, we observed a significant positive correlation between MMR and total fertility (r = 0.32, p = 0.025) and a significant negative correlation between MMR and maternal age at first birth (r = -0.40, p = 0.005). Additionally, a significant correlation was observed with the cumulative percentage of mothers attending post-natal clinics, the prevalence of thinness (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), HIV infection in women (r = 0.20, p = 0.164), and physical violence during pregnancy. The model estimate of national MMR in 2022 was 367 deaths per 100,000 live births, ranging from 49 deaths per 100,000 live births in Kisii County to 1794 deaths per 100,000 live births in Turkana County. Conclusion Although MMR in Kenya displayed a general downward trend, our model’s estimates for DHS 2022 indicate an increase compared to the 2019 National Census and Housing Survey estimate of 355 deaths per 100,000 live births. This rise may be attributed to COVID-19-related maternal deaths during the same period. The integration of predictive models to inform interventions and resource allocation could play a crucial role in enhancing maternal healthcare outcomes in Kenya.",

        "title": "Prediction of delayed breastfeeding initiation among mothers having children less than 2 months of age in East Africa: application of machine learning algorithms",
        "abstract": "Background Delayed breastfeeding initiation is a significant public health concern, and reducing the proportion of delayed breastfeeding initiation in East Africa is a key strategy for lowering the Child Mortality rate. However, there is limited evidence on this public health issue assessed using advanced models. Therefore, this study aimed to assess prediction of delayed initiation of breastfeeding initiation and associated factors among women with less than 2 months of a child in East Africa using the machine learning approach. Methods A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset covering the years 2011 to 2021. Using statistical software (Python version 3.11), nine supervised machine learning algorithms were applied to a weighted sample of 31,640 women and assessed using performance measures. To pinpoint significant factors and predict delayed breastfeeding initiation in East Africa, this study also employed the most widely used outlines of Yufeng Guo’s steps of supervised machine learning. Results The pooled prevalence of delayed breastfeeding initiation in East Africa was 31.33% with 95% CI (24.16–38.49). Delayed breastfeeding initiation was highest in Comoros and low in Burundi. Among the nine machine learning algorithms, the random forest model was fitted for this study. The association rule mining result revealed that home delivery, delivered by cesarean section, poor wealth status, poor access to media outlets, women aged between 35 and 49 years, and women who had distance problems accessing health facilities were associated with delayed breastfeeding initiation in East Africa. Conclusion The prevalence of delayed breastfeeding initiation was high. The findings highlight the multifaceted nature of breastfeeding practices and the need to consider socioeconomic, healthcare, and demographic variables when addressing breastfeeding initiation timelines in the region. Policymakers and stakeholders pay attention to the significant factors and we recommend targeted interventions to improve healthcare accessibility, enhance media outreach, and support women of lower socioeconomic status. These measures can encourage timely breastfeeding initiation and address the identified factors contributing to delays across the region.",

        "abstract": "Background Adverse pregnancy outcomes pose significant risk to maternal and neonatal health, contributing to morbidity, mortality, and long-term developmental challenges. This study aimed to predict these outcomes in Rwanda using supervised machine learning algorithms. Methods This cross-sectional study utilized data from the Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (RDHS, 2019–2020) involving 14,634 women. K-fold cross-validation (k = 10) and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) were used to manage dataset partitioning and class imbalance. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the prevalence and risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Seven machine learning algorithms were assessed for their accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Results Of the pregnancies analyzed, 93.4% resulted in live births, while 4.5% ended in miscarriage, and 2.1% in stillbirth. Advanced maternal age(>30 years),women aged 30–34 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.755; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.085–10.074; p < 0.001), 35–39 years (AOR = 8.458; 95% CI = 4.507–10.571; p < 0.001), 40–44 years (AOR = 11.86; 95% CI = 6.250–21.842; p < 0.001), and 45–49 years (AOR = 14.233; 95% CI = 7.359–25.922; p < 0.001), compared to those aged 15–19 years, and multiple unions (polyandry) (AOR = 1.320; 95% CI = 1.104–1.573, p = 0.002), and women not visited by healthcare provider during pregnancy (AOR = 1.421; 95%CI = 1.300–1.611, p<0.001) were factors associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In contrast, being married (AOR = 0.894; 95% CI = 0.787–0.966) and attending at least two antenatal care (ANC) visits (AOR = 0.801; 95% CI = 0.664–0.961) were linked to reduced risk. The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model outperformed other ML Models in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes, achieving 86% accuracy, 89% precision, 97% recall, 93% F1 score, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.842. The ML models constantly highlighted that woman with advanced maternal age, those in multiple unions, and inadequate ANC were more susceptible to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms, particularly KNN, are effective in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes, facilitating early intervention and improved maternal and neonatal care.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes, a widespread chronic ailment in the United States, imposes significant economic and health burdens, impacting quality of life and life expectancy. This study analyzes a clinical dataset of 253,680 patients from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The dataset encompasses 21 predictors, including high blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), smoking, stroke, heart disease, physical activity, fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, alcohol consumption, insurance coverage, lack of medical visits due to financial constraints, general health, days with mental health issues, days with physical injuries in the past 30 days, difficulties in walking, gender, age, income, and education level. The objective is to balance the training dataset, compare different supervised machine learning models, and identify critical clinical features contributing to diabetes using unsupervised feature selection methods. A total of 34 machine learning models in MATLAB2023a were trained and compared. Quadratic Support Vector Machine (SVM), Coarse Gaussian SVM, and Narrow Neural Networks achieved the highest training accuracy (76.3%), while the Bilayered Neural Network attained 74.7% on an unseen test dataset. Among all, Quadratic SVM demonstrated the best overall performance based on average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Feature selection highlighted nine key predictors: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, BMI, heart disease, physical activity, general health, recent bodily injuries, mobility issues, and age. A model trained on these features achieved a commendable accuracy of 75.4%, demonstrating the feasibility of a simplified, efficient diagnostic tool with a diagnostic efficacy of 0.7.\nThis study underscores the potential of streamlined models to predict diabetes with fewer parameters while maintaining high accuracy, offering a valuable tool for healthcare diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nIn the pediatric surgical population, Emergence Delirium (ED) poses a significant challenge. This study aims to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models to identify key features associated with ED and predict its occurrence in children undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe analysis involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), supervised predictive modeling, and unsupervised learning on a medical dataset (n = 423). After preliminary data cleaning, EDA encompassed plotting histograms, boxplots, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps to understand variable distributions and relationships. Four predictive models were trained including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The models were evaluated and compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC), precision, recall, and feature importance. The RF model showed better performance and was used for the test (AUC-ROC 0.96, precision 1.00, and recall 0.92 on the validation set). K-means clustering was applied to find groups within the data. Elbow method and silhouette scores were used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The formed clusters were analyzed by aggregating features to understand the characteristics of each cluster.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEDA revealed significant positive correlations between age, weight, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) health score, and surgery duration with the risk of developing ED. Among the ML models, RF achieved the highest performance. Key predictive variables, based on the model's feature importance, included delirium screening scales, extubation time, and time to regain consciousness. Unsupervised K-means clustering identified 2-3 optimal clusters, which represented distinct patient subgroups: younger, healthier, low-risk individuals (cluster 0), and older patients with increasing chronic disease burden, higher delirium screening scores, and consequently higher post-operative delirium risk (clusters 1 and 2).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nML techniques are valuable tools for extracting insights and making accurate predictions from healthcare data. High-performing algorithm-based models can be implemented for clinical decision support systems, facilitating early identification and intervention for ED in pediatric patients. By investigating various variables, it is possible to assess risk and implement preventive measures effectively. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering reveals distinct patient subgroups, enabling personalized perioperative management strategies and enhancing overall patient care.",

        "title": "Involvement of Machine Learning Tools in Healthcare Decision Making",
        "abstract": "In the present day, there are many diseases which need to be identified at their early stages to start relevant treatments. If not, they could be uncurable and deadly. Due to this reason, there is a need of analysing complex medical data, medical reports, and medical images at a lesser time but with greater accuracy. There are even some instances where certain abnormalities cannot be directly recognized by humans. In healthcare for computational decision making, machine learning approaches are being used in these types of situations where a crucial data analysis needs to be performed on medical data to reveal hidden relationships or abnormalities which are not visible to humans. Implementing algorithms to perform such tasks itself is difficult, but what makes it even more challenging is to increase the accuracy of the algorithm while decreasing the required time for the algorithm to execute. In the early days, processing of large amount of medical data was an important task which resulted in machine learning being adapted in the biological domain. Since this happened, the biology and biomedical fields have been reaching higher levels by exploring more knowledge and identifying relationships which were never observed before. Reaching to its peak now the concern is being diverted towards treating patients not only based on the type of disease but also their genetics, which is known as precision medicine. Modifications in machine learning algorithms are being performed and tested daily to improve the performance of the algorithms in analysing and presenting more accurate information. In the healthcare field, starting from information extraction from medical documents until the prediction or diagnosis of a disease, machine learning has been involved. Medical imaging is a section that was greatly improved with the integration of machine learning algorithms to the field of computational biology. Nowadays, many disease diagnoses are being performed by medical image processing using machine learning algorithms. In addition, patient care, resource allocation, and research on treatments for various diseases are also being performed using machine learning-based computational decision making. Throughout this paper, various machine learning algorithms and approaches that are being used for decision making in the healthcare sector will be discussed along with the involvement of machine learning in healthcare applications in the current context. With the explored knowledge, it was evident that neural network-based deep learning methods have performed extremely well in the field of computational biology with the support of the high processing power of modern sophisticated computers and are being extensively applied because of their high predicting accuracy and reliability. When giving concern towards the big picture by combining the observations, it is noticeable that computational biology and biomedicine-based decision making in healthcare have now become dependent on machine learning algorithms, and thus they cannot be separated from the field of artificial intelligence.",

        "title": "Early diabetes risk classification using supervised learning algorithms",
        "abstract": "Diabetes is one of the most devastating diseases and affects many people. Diabetes can be caused by a variety of causes, including ageing, obesity, inactivity, genetics, a poor diet, high blood pressure, and others. Diabetes increases the likelihood of developing several illnesses, including heart disease, renal disease, stroke, eye problems, nerve damage, etc. The information needed to diagnose diabetes is currently gathered through a variety of tests used in hospitals, and the diagnosis is then used to determine the best course of treatment. The healthcare sector has a considerable application for machine learning (ML). Databases in the healthcare sector are very vast. Big datasets can be examined using ML techniques to find hidden information and patterns, allowing one to learn from the data and predict outcomes properly. Using the existing methods, the forecast’s accuracy is not very good. In this study, we proposed an early diabetes prediction model that incorporates several extrinsic characteristics that contribute to the development of diabetes together with more widely used measures like polyuria, weight loss, polyphagia, visual blurring, alopecia, obesity, etc. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Logistic Regression (LOR), the Boosted Tree (BOT), and the Bagged Tree (BAT) are four different classifiers that are utilized in this paper to predict diabetes early on. The device’s performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and f-measure. Results show that among the classifiers, BAT has the highest accuracy, at 98%.",

        "title": "Unveiling the Power of Data: A Journey Through Machine Learning Techniques",
        "abstract": "Machine Learning Techniques: Unveiling the Power of Data-Driven Solutions\nMachine learning (ML) has become a transformative force across disciplines, revolutionizing how computers extract knowledge from data and tackle complex tasks without explicit programming. This research paper delves into the core principles of machine learning, exploring its fundamental techniques and their far-reaching applications. We embark on a journey through the two main paradigms that govern learning: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised learning equips algorithms to make informed predictions based on labeled data, encompassing tasks like spam filtering, disease diagnosis, and stock market forecasting. The algorithm ingests this data, which includes both the input features and the corresponding desired output, and learns the intricate relationships between them. This empowers it to generalize this knowledge to unseen data, enabling accurate predictions.\nUnsupervised learning, in contrast, thrives on unlabeled data, where the data points lack predefined categories or target variables. Here, the objective is to uncover the inherent structures or patterns within the data itself. Unsupervised learning techniques are invaluable for tasks like data clustering, where similar data points are grouped together to reveal underlying relationships. Additionally, they play a crucial role in dimensionality reduction, a process of compressing high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space for efficient processing and analysis. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with massive datasets that may overwhelm traditional computational methods.\nBeyond these fundamental paradigms, the landscape of machine learning extends further. Deep learning, a subfield inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers. These complex networks are adept at learning intricate patterns from vast amounts of data, achieving remarkable success in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Deep learning models, for instance, power facial recognition technology, enabling our devices to identify individuals with exceptional accuracy. In the realm of natural language processing, deep learning algorithms fuel machine translation systems, allowing seamless communication across languages.\nReinforcement learning presents another powerful approach. Here, an agent interacts with an environment, learning through trial and error. The agent receives rewards for desired actions and penalties for undesired ones, constantly refining its decision-making process. This approach has applications in robotics, where robots can learn to navigate complex environments and perform tasks with increasing autonomy. Reinforcement learning is also used in game playing, where AI agents can learn optimal strategies through self-play and achieve superhuman levels of performance.\nAs machine learning continues its exponential growth, ethical considerations become paramount. Potential biases within the training data can lead to discriminatory outcomes in areas like loan approvals or facial recognition software. Additionally, the explainability and transparency of complex models, particularly deep learning models, raise concerns. To ensure responsible development and deployment of ML, addressing these issues is crucial. The field requires robust methodologies to mitigate bias in training data and develop techniques that make complex models interpretable, allowing us to understand the rationale behind their predictions.\nLooking towards the horizon, the future of machine learning is brimming with potential. From personalized healthcare with tailored treatment plans to self-driving cars that navigate roads with exceptional precision, ML promises to revolutionize various aspects of our lives. Continuous research and development will enhance the capabilities and robustness of machine learning models, further expanding their reach and impact. By harnessing the power of data and fostering responsible development practices, machine learning will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping a more intelligent and data-driven future",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) has the potential ability to predict and draw patterns from the voluminous clinical and convoluted data from the healthcare system. Cardiovascular disease is a serious lethal syndrome that affects the heart and blood vessels. Prediction of heart disease (HD) is one of the most crucial challenges in the domain of medical data analysis. Early prediction of the disease by the identification of risk factors using machine learning algorithms could impede the severity of the disease and save the lives of several individuals. In this research work, we have investigated different supervised learning models which perform effective roles in predicting cardiovascular disease. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been utilized to reduce the features to improve the effectiveness of the learning process. Prediction of heart disease is attained by implementing the concepts of supervised machine learning (SML) algorithms such as Gradient Boosting (GB), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) methods. The models are examined and evaluated by various metrics like Precision, Recall, Area Under Curve (AUC), Accuracy, and F1-score. The RF model outperforms the others when the models are evaluated, with an accuracy of 86.81 % for data set DS1 and 99.02% for data set DS2.",

The patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) require continuous services of testing, following-up and monitoring. Offering these services to patients smoothly at any time needs to integrated healthcare system. The recent development in information systems and technologies facilitate introducing such healthcare systems. This paper proposed an integrated system model, which offers the services of testing, following-up and monitoring patients with (SCD). The proposed system uses support vector machine SVM, which is supervised machine learning approach to analyze the collected data of a specific patient and takes the appropriate action such as send alert message to the healthcare staff. To perform the classification process, four methods are applied with SVM algorithm, which are Sequential Minimal Optimization SMO, Rules JRIP, Tree Decision Stump and Naive Bays for comparative analysis. In this paper, many experiments were implemented based on the four machine learning algorithms to determine patients of SCD from normal patients. The results were promising as they show 99% classifications were accurate when using SMO algorithm.",

        "title": "Applied machine learning for the risk-stratification and clinical decision support of hospitalised patients with dengue in Vietnam",
        "abstract": "Background Identifying patients at risk of dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is vital for effective healthcare delivery. This can be challenging in endemic settings because of high caseloads and limited resources. Machine learning models trained using clinical data could support decision-making in this context. Methods We developed supervised machine learning prediction models using pooled data from adult and paediatric patients hospitalised with dengue. Individuals from 5 prospective clinical studies in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam conducted between 12th April 2001 and 30th January 2018 were included. The outcome was onset of dengue shock syndrome during hospitalisation. Data underwent random stratified splitting at 80:20 ratio with the former used only for model development. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for hyperparameter optimisation and confidence intervals derived from percentile bootstrapping. Optimised models were evaluated against the hold-out set. Findings The final dataset included 4,131 patients (477 adults and 3,654 children). DSS was experienced by 222 (5.4%) of individuals. Predictors were age, sex, weight, day of illness at hospitalisation, indices of haematocrit and platelets over first 48 hours of admission and before the onset of DSS. An artificial neural network model (ANN) model had best performance with an area under receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76–0.85) in predicting DSS. When evaluated against the independent hold-out set this calibrated model exhibited an AUROC of 0.82, specificity of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.66, positive predictive value of 0.18 and negative predictive value of 0.98. Interpretation The study demonstrates additional insights can be obtained from basic healthcare data, when applied through a machine learning framework. The high negative predictive value could support interventions such as early discharge or ambulatory patient management in this population. Work is underway to incorporate these findings into an electronic clinical decision support system to guide individual patient management.",

        "title": "Towards Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning on Audio Embeddings for Label Classification",
        "abstract": "The increasing importance of audio-based healthcare diagnostics, particularly in chronic respiratory problems, has prompted the development of novel approaches for disease classification using the full spectrum analysis of cough sounds. This paper presents an innovative study exploring the potential of employing supervised and semi-supervised learning methodologies for disease categorization based on cough audio samples. Specifically, this study focuses on scenarios characterized by a shortage of annotated data related to chronic diseases. The objectives of our study involved the utilization of standard machine learning algorithms for direct classification based on embeddings, as well as the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the KNN graph. Preliminary results indicate that GNN models consistently outperformed traditional classifiers. For instance, with just 1 % of the data, GAT and GCN achieved AUC PR values of 0.84 and 0.87, respectively, surpassing all traditional methods. The superiority mentioned above was sustained even when the data fraction was augmented to 3% and 5%. The usefulness of graph neural networks (GNNs) was further supported by comprehensive performance measures, wherein the graph convolutional network (GCN) exhibited exceptional preci-sion and PR (precision-recall). In summary, the AudioVecDiagnosis framework presents a promising opportunity for further investigation in audio-based healthcare diagnostics. It provides an optimum approach for situations with a limited availability of labeled data.",

One of these medical applications is the early prediction system for heart diseases especially; coronary artery disease (CAD) also called atherosclerosis. The need for a medical diagnosis support system is to detect atherosclerosis at the earlier stages to optimize the diagnosis, avoid the advanced cases, and reduce treatment costs. Earlier, the datasets are collected from specific medical sources and have evaluated against computer applications. In this paper, a supervised machine learning medical diagnosis support system (MDSS) for atherosclerosis prediction is presented that able to obtain and learn automatically knowledge from each patient's clinical data. Therefore, we used three Machine Learning (ML) classifiers for the proposed MDSS for atherosclerosis. Thus, this work is accomplished using databases collected from the UCI repository (Cleveland, Hungarian) and Sani Z-Alizadeh dataset. The performance metrics were computed utilizing Accuracy, Recall and Precision. Furthermore, F1-score and Matthews’s correlation coefficient these measures were also calculated to greatly increase the proposed system performance. Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation methods have been used for proposed model performance evaluation that achieved 94% as the best accuracy average. Consequently, the proposed model can be used to support healthcare and facilitate largescale clinical diagnostic of atherosclerosis diseases.",

        "abstract": "Heart disease (HD) cases are increasing rapidly every day, so it is very crucial to detect them beforehand. In recent times, machine learning algorithms (MLA) are trending for heart or cardiovascular disease prediction in the healthcare field. Data mining techniques such as reinforcement, unsupervised, and supervised play a crucial role in examining the enormous amount of data in the medical field industry. The available dataset of HD individuals from the Cleveland database of the UCI repository is employed to test and verify the performance of MLA. This article makes an early prediction of HD by executing different MLA, for example, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR). After the comparative study of three algorithms, we found that the DT is the most efficient algorithm with the highest accuracy of 94.7 percent. This value is higher than the recently reported value of 83.87 percent.",

This paper provides a new PSC mathematical cost model, which includes Blockchain technology (BT), that can improve the safety, performance, and transparency of medical information sharing in a healthcare system. We aim to estimate the costs of the BT-based PSC model, select algorithms with minimum prediction errors, and determine the cost components of the model. After the data generation, we applied four Supervised Learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine, and naive Bayes) combined with two Evolutionary Computation algorithms (ant colony optimization and the firefly algorithm). We also used the Feature Weighting approach to assign appropriate weights to all cost model components, revealing their importance. Four performance metrics were used to evaluate the cost model, and the total ranking score (TRS) was used to determine the most reliable predictive algorithms. Our findings show that the ACO-NB and FA-NB algorithms perform better than the other six algorithms in estimating the costs of the model with lower errors, whereas ACO-DT and FA-DT show the worst performance. The findings also indicate that the shortage cost, holding cost, and expired medication cost more strongly influence the cost model than other cost components.",

        "title": "Predicting the Severity of Lockdown-Induced Psychiatric Symptoms with Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the incidence of psychiatric disorders in the general population and an increase in the severity of symptoms in psychiatric patients have been reported. Anxiety and depression symptoms are the most commonly observed during large-scale dramatic events such as pandemics and wars, especially when these implicate an extended lockdown. The early detection of higher risk clinical and non-clinical individuals would help prevent the new onset and/or deterioration of these symptoms. This in turn would lead to the implementation of public policies aimed at protecting vulnerable populations during these dramatic contingencies, therefore optimising the effectiveness of interventions and saving the resources of national healthcare systems. We used a supervised machine learning method to identify the predictors of the severity of psychiatric symptoms during the Italian lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Via a case study, we applied this methodology to a small sample of healthy individuals, obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, and adjustment disorder patients. Our preliminary results show that our models were able to predict depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms during the lockdown with up to 92% accuracy based on demographic and clinical characteristics collected before the pandemic. The presented methodology may be used to predict the psychiatric prognosis of individuals under a large-scale lockdown and thus supporting the related clinical decisions.",

        "title": "Detection of Cardiovascular Disease of Patients at an Early Stage Using Machine Learning Algorithms",
        "abstract": "Among the significant causes of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) account for 80 percent of deaths in low- and middle-income countries such as Bangladesh, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In Bangladesh, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and the mortality linked with it have climbed considerably over the past few decades. The rising incidence of cardiovascular disease in Bangladesh needs a complete understanding of the epidemiology of CVD risk among the population. Clinical data analysis is a significant concern for someone dealing with cardiovascular illness. When it comes to generating decisions and making predictions from the vast volumes of data generated by the healthcare industry, machine learning (ML) is to be extremely useful. It is proposed in this research to apply a supervised machine learning algorithm to detect cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals early on, allowing them to become concerned about their medical status and avert significant illnesses. When it comes to detecting the disease, four different machine learning methods have been used. The dataset of patients was used, and various machine learning methods, including K-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, Decision trees, and XGBoost, were used to make predictions. As a consequence of the tests, the XGBoost method is superior to the other three tactics (73.72 percent). Moreover, for the modified dataset where smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity are positive, the percentage is 81.14% to show the effect of smoking and alcohol consumption in a physically active person in terms of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, these strategies have been evaluated regarding their ability to detect early-stage CVD inpatients. This paper examined the Kaggle dataset to observe the trait and suitability to implement the system for primary data collected from Bangladeshi patients.",

Artificial intelligence technologies are fundamentally changing the global healthcare system, making it possible to radically rebuild the system of medical diagnostics while reducing healthcare costs. AI is actively used in research to develop methods for diagnosing coronary heart disease (CHD). There are different types of CHD. Before treating a disease, it is necessary to determine which class of diseases it belongs to. Based on the feature space of the disease, it is possible to classify the type of CHD. Machine learning algorithms can solve this problem. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve classification problems. The dataset is the more important part of the supervised machine learning algorithm for training. Gathering data is the most important step in solving any supervised machine learning problem. But choosing more important part from the collected data is one of the tasks to be solved. The main purpose of this study is to select more useful parametric attributes from the dataset to obtain a high F1-score of CHD classification.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, humans can recognize their daily activities by using smartphone activity recognition. Numerous studies have been conducted to identify activities, but for some reason, the classifiers’ performance is poor due to various issues with the data or the classifiers themselves. This study provides a way to obtain the most effective classifiers. A comparative study was conducted to evaluate the performance of supervised and ensemble learning classifiers. In this study, a system that is based on the best-performing classifier is also introduced. Two publicly accessible datasets of recognized human activities from the UCI repository are used to assess the approach. The first is Human Activities based recognition and Postural Transitions, and the second is UCI-Human Activity Recognition. For this research study, the many different activities have been chosen like walking, standing, sitting, lying down, and upstairs. These input signals represent a challenging 3-dimensional raw data format. The Principal Elements In order to extract the most significant data features for the classification of human activities, the analysis (PCA) technique is used to reduce the dimensionalities of the data features. HAR involves the automatic identification and classification of human activities based on information which are collected from sensors, cameras, and wearable devices. It has become increasingly essential in healthcare for monitoring and early detection, in fitness and sports for performance tracking, and in security for suspicious behaviour identification.",

        "abstract": "Automated tuning of gate-defined quantum dots is a requirement for large-scale semiconductor-based qubit initialisation. An essential step of these tuning procedures is charge-state detection based on charge stability diagrams. Using supervised machine learning to perform this task requires a large dataset for models to train on. In order to avoid hand labelling experimental data, synthetic data has been explored as an alternative. While providing a significant increase in the size of the training dataset compared to using experimental data, using synthetic data means that classifiers are trained on data sourced from a different distribution than the experimental data that is part of the tuning process. Here we evaluate the prediction accuracy of a range of machine learning models trained on simulated and experimental data, and their ability to generalise to experimental charge stability diagrams in two-dimensional electron gas and nanowire devices. We find that classifiers perform best on either purely experimental or a combination of synthetic and experimental training data, and that adding common experimental noise signatures to the synthetic data does not dramatically improve the classification accuracy. These results suggest that experimental training data as well as realistic quantum dot simulations and noise models are essential in charge-state detection using supervised machine learning.",

        "title": "Classify the Outcome of Arterial Blood Gas Test to Detect the Respiratory Failure Using Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Analysis of Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) is an important investigation to measure oxygenation and blood acid levels. It is crucial in measuring the clinical status and contributes to an efficient and effective healthcare plan. Generally, ABG is applied in the emergency care units (ECU) and intensive care units (ICU). Most of the time, the doctors and nurses have difficulties identifying the type of respiratory failure with the help of ABG test results. So, during this research with the adaption of certain supervised machine learning approaches, namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Catboost, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), LightGBM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Network (NN) and Decision Tree and have been incorporated with the intension of identifying the type of the respiratory failure with the highest accurate technique. To fulfil this purpose, 700 patient test results have been obtained from a public hospital in Sri Lanka. From the results discovered, XGBoost outperformed against all other techniques in identifying the type of respiratory failure with the highest accuracy of 98.65% and the lowest error rate of 1.35%. To ensure whether the XGBoost outperformed against the different percentages of training and testing data, K-fold cross-validation with five folds also has been performed with the dataset. The cross-validation produces results with an accuracy of 98.45% and the lowest error rate of 1.55%. In conclusion, XGBoost has been utilised in developing the prediction model. This would be a promising start for a future research scholar to adopt the hybrid techniques and the deep learning techniques to identify the causes of respiratory failure and the prediction of the type of respiratory failure.",

        "abstract": "To increase healthcare quality, early illness prediction helps patients prevent potentially life-threatening health issues before it is too late. Artificial intelligence is a rapidly evolving area, and its applications to diabetes, a worldwide epidemic, have the potential to revolutionize the way diabetes is diagnosed and managed. A total of six supervised machine learning algorithms based on patient data were used and compared to predict the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. For experiments, the Pima Indians Diabetes Database was used, and their missing values were carefully handled by different techniques. For random train-test splits, the Random Forest classification algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 92 percent. This model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches due to the application of a combination of techniques for dealing with missing values (the mixture of imputing missing values techniques) that is proposed. With this approach, the models of this manuscript achieved better accuracy than prior work done with the Pima diabetes data.",

        "abstract": "Obesity has always been a problem which has plagued humans for many generations, which, since the 1975, almost doubled to turn into a global epidemic. The current human dependence on technology has contributed to the problem even more, with the effects visibly pronounced in late teenagers and early adults. Researchers till date, have tried numerous ways to determine the factors that cause obesity in early adults. On that frontier, our hybrid machine-learning model uses the help of some supervised and unsupervised data mining methods like Extremely Randomized Trees, Multilayer Perceptron and XGBoost using Python to detect and predict obesity levels and help healthcare professionals to combat this phenomenon. Our dataset is a publicly available dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing the data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The proposed model heavily utilizes feature engineering methods and introduces the concept of a hybrid model. This work has shown improved results over prior works and extensive studies have been undertaken to preserve the robustness of this model.",

        "title": "Monitoring of a Nearshore Small Dolphin Species Using Passive Acoustic Platforms and Supervised Machine Learning Techniques",
        "abstract": "Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is increasingly being adopted as a non-invasive method for the assessment of ocean ecological dynamics. PAM is an important sampling approach for acquiring critical information about marine mammals, especially in areas where data are lacking and where evaluations of threats for vulnerable populations are required. The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (IPHD, Sousa chinensis) is a coastal species which inhabits tropical and warm-temperate waters from the eastern Indian Ocean throughout Southeast Asia to central China. A new population of this species was recently discovered in waters southwest of Hainan Island, China. An array of passive acoustic platforms was deployed at depths of 10–20 m (the preferred habitat of humpback dolphins), across sites covering more than 100 km of coastline. In this study, we explored whether the acoustic data recorded by the array could be used to classify IPHD echolocation clicks, with the aim of investigating the spatiotemporal patterns of distribution and acoustic behavior of this species. A number of supervised machine learning algorithms were trained to automatically classify echolocation clicks from the different types of short-broadband pulses recorded. The best performance was reported by a cubic support vector machine (Cubic SVM), which was applied to 19,215 5-min recordings (∼4.2 TB), collected over a period of 75 days at six locations. Subsequently, using spectrogram visualization and audio listening, human operators confirmed the presence of clicks within the selected files. Additionally, other dolphin vocalizations (including whistles, buzzes, and burst pulses) and different sound sources (soniferous fishes, snapping shrimps, human activities) were also reported. The detection range of IPHD clicks was estimated using a transmission loss (TL) model and the performance of the trained classifier was compared with data synchronously collected by an acoustic data logger (A-tag). This study demonstrates that the distribution and habitat use of a coastal and resident dolphin species can be monitored over a large spatiotemporal scale, using an array of passive acoustic platforms and a data analysis protocol that includes both machine learning techniques and spectrogram inspection.",

        "abstract": "Heart disease, alternatively known as cardiovascular disease, encases various conditions that impact the heart and is the primary basis of death worldwide over the span of the past few decades. It associates many risk factors in heart disease and a need of the time to get accurate, reliable, and sensible approaches to make an early diagnosis to achieve prompt management of the disease. Data mining is a commonly used technique for processing enormous data in the healthcare domain. Researchers apply several data mining and machine learning techniques to analyse huge complex medical data, helping healthcare professionals to predict heart disease. This research paper presents various attributes related to heart disease, and the model on basis of supervised learning algorithms as Naïve Bayes, decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, and random forest algorithm. It uses the existing dataset from the Cleveland database of UCI repository of heart disease patients. The dataset comprises 303 instances and 76 attributes. Of these 76 attributes, only 14 attributes are considered for testing, important to substantiate the performance of different algorithms. This research paper aims to envision the probability of developing heart disease in the patients. The results portray that the highest accuracy score is achieved with K-nearest neighbor.",

        "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is a condition characterized by the presence of repeated complete or partial collapse of the upper airways during sleep associated with episodes of intermittent hypoxia, leading to fragmentation of sleep, sympathetic nervous system activation, and oxidative stress. To date, one of the major aims of research is to find out a simplified non-invasive screening system for this still underdiagnosed disease. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ) is the most widely used questionnaire for OSA and is a beneficial screening tool devised to select subjects with a high likelihood of having OSA. We administered the original ten-question Berlin questionnaire, enriched with a set of questions purposely prepared by our team and completing the socio-demographic, clinical, and anamnestic picture, to a sample of Italian professional nurses in order to investigate the possible impact of OSA disease on healthcare systems. According to the Berlin questionnaire, respondents were categorized as high-risk and low-risk of having OSA. For both risk groups, baseline characteristics, work information, clinical factors, and symptoms were assessed. Anthropometric data, work information, health status, and symptoms were significantly different between OSA high-risk and low-risk groups. Through supervised feature selection and Machine Learning, we also reduced the original BQ to a very limited set of items which seem capable of reproducing the outcome of the full BQ: this reduced group of questions may be useful to determine the risk of sleep apnea in screening cases where questionnaire compilation time must be kept as short as possible.",

        "title": "Machine Learning Based Diabetes Classification and Prediction for Healthcare Applications",
        "abstract": "The remarkable advancements in biotechnology and public healthcare infrastructures have led to a momentous production of critical and sensitive healthcare data. By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases. Diabetes mellitus is an extremely life-threatening disease because it contributes to other lethal diseases, i.e., heart, kidney, and nerve damage. In this paper, a machine learning based approach has been proposed for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes. Furthermore, it also presents an IoT-based hypothetical diabetes monitoring system for a healthy and affected person to monitor his blood glucose (BG) level. For diabetes classification, three different classifiers have been employed, i.e., random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LR). For predictive analysis, we have employed long short-term memory (LSTM), moving averages (MA), and linear regression (LR). For experimental evaluation, a benchmark PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is used. During the analysis, it is observed that MLP outperforms other classifiers with 86.08% of accuracy and LSTM improves the significant prediction with 87.26% accuracy of diabetes. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed approach is also performed with existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed approach in many public healthcare applications.",

Machine learning (ML) is a subtype of AI; it refers to the ability of computers to draw conclusions (ie, learn) from data without being directly programmed. ML builds from traditional statistical methods and has drawn significant interest in healthcare epidemiology due to its potential for improving disease prediction and patient care. This review provides an overview of ML in healthcare epidemiology and practical examples of ML tools used to support healthcare decision making at 4 stages of hospital-based care: triage, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge. Examples include model-building efforts to assist emergency department triage, predicting time before septic shock onset, detecting community-acquired pneumonia, and classifying COVID-19 disposition risk level. Increasing availability and quality of electronic health record (EHR) data as well as computing power provides opportunities for ML to increase patient safety, improve the efficiency of clinical management, and reduce healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Active health screening for CRC yielded detection of an increasingly younger adults. However, current machine learning algorithms that are trained using older adults and smaller datasets, may not perform well in practice for large populations. Aim To evaluate machine learning algorithms using large datasets accounting for both younger and older adults from multiple regions and diverse sociodemographics. Methods A large dataset including 109,343 participants in a dietary-based colorectal cancer ase study from Canada, India, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States was collected by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This global dietary database was augmented with other publicly accessible information from multiple sources. Nine supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated on the aggregated dataset. Results Both supervised and unsupervised models performed well in predicting CRC and non-CRC phenotypes. A prediction model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) was found to be the optimal algorithm with CRC misclassification of 1% and non-CRC misclassification of 3%. Conclusions ANN models trained on large heterogeneous datasets may be applicable for both younger and older adults. Such models provide a solid foundation for building effective clinical decision support systems assisting healthcare providers in dietary-related, non-invasive screening that can be applied in large studies. Using optimal algorithms coupled with high compliance to cancer screening is expected to significantly improve early diagnoses and boost the success rate of timely and appropriate cancer interventions.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed widespread adoption of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) techniques due to their superior performance for a variety of healthcare applications ranging from the prediction of cardiac arrest from one-dimensional heart signals to computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) using multi-dimensional medical images. Notwithstanding the impressive performance of ML/DL, there are still lingering doubts regarding the robustness of ML/DL in healthcare settings (which is traditionally considered quite challenging due to the myriad security and privacy issues involved), especially in light of recent results that have shown that ML/DL are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present an overview of various application areas in healthcare that leverage such techniques from security and privacy point of view and present associated challenges. In addition, we present potential methods to ensure secure and privacy-preserving ML for healthcare applications. Finally, we provide insight into the current research challenges and promising directions for future research.",

        "abstract": ": Rising healthcare challenges, particularly undiagnosed heart disease due to subtle symptoms and limited access to diagnostics, necessitate innovative solutions. This study introduces an innovative Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for early detection, leveraging the strengths of both fuzzy logic and machine learning. By analyzing patient-specific data such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, galvanic skin response, and body temperature, our system utilizes fuzzy logic to evaluate potential disease symptoms, enabling self-diagnosis under medical supervision. This personalized approach enables individuals to monitor their health and seek prompt medical attention as needed. Additionally, we train multiple machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the well-established Cleveland heart disease dataset. Among these, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (82.6%), precision (81.5%), recall (83.7%), and F1-Score (82.5%), showcasing its e ff ectiveness in predicting cardiovascular disease. This unique blend of fuzzy logic for personalized symptom assessment and machine learning for CVD prediction presents a new method for early diagnosis. While promising, further validation through large-scale clinical trials is essential. Ultimately, this system underscores the significance of integrating AI with medical expertise for optimal patient care, providing a potential pathway to improved health outcomes and enhanced accessibility to early detection of cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare fraud is a serious problem that affects the financial health and trust in healthcare systems around the world. This research paper focuses on using machine learning to detect fraudulent activities by healthcare providers. We analyze large amounts of data from Medicare claims to find unusual patterns that may indicate fraud. By using different machine learning methods, such as decision trees and random forests, we create a model that can accurately separate legitimate claims from fraudulent ones. To tackle the challenge of imbalanced data, we apply techniques like oversampling, which helps improve our model's performance. Our results show that this machine learning approach significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of fraud detection compared to traditional methods. Additionally, our findings provide valuable insights for healthcare administrators and policymakers, helping them take action against fraud more effectively. By incorporating these advanced techniques into existing systems, we aim to support efforts to protect healthcare resources and improve patient care. This research not only adds to the understanding of fraud detection in healthcare but also offers practical solutions to fight against it effectively.

        "title": "A Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Model for Risk Analysis of Urinary Tract Infections in People with Dementia",
        "abstract": "Background: Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are common conditions in the elderly population and one of the key causes of hospital admissions in people with dementia. One of the key challenges in dealing with UTIs is that the condition often remains undiagnosed until it advances and shows severe symptoms which can lead to hospitalisation.      \n \nMethod: This study presents a new system for detecting UTI in people with dementia. The system relies on low-cost in-home sensory monitoring combined with a novel machine learning algorithm. Environmental and physiological monitoring devices provide continuous data collection from homes, and the proposed machine learning model is trained to extract and identify the risk of UTIs. In conditions such as UTI, collecting sufficient training data to train machine learning models is a challenging task. The limited access to labelled data and examples creates the risk that learning models can become overfitted or biased. We propose a semi-supervised learning model to process a large unlabelled data set in combination with a smaller labelled dataset. We use an unsupervised learning technique which trains a model by extracting the underlying features from a set of unlabelled data and use the probabilistic neural network to estimate the density distribution. We use the unsupervised model for feature extraction and use these features from the smaller dataset to train a supervised classifier.  The proposed approach is tested in real-world application and within a healthcare monitoring system with 110 participants.    \n \nFinding: The proposed system can record the environmental and clinical data in an integrated framework. This provides information for the proposed machine learning model to identify the risks of UTIs by processing the patterns and changes in vital signs and activity patterns. The evaluation results show that the proposed model can detect the risk of UITs with an F1-score of 84%, which outperforms the baseline methods by 10% on average.    \n \nInterpretation: The proposed model uses continuous environmental monitoring data and vital signs to detect early symptoms and the risk of UTIs. This is a first study using deep learning and semi-supervised models to analyse in-home sensory data in remote healthcare monitoring scenarios. The model provides a new approach to analyse and interpret continuous observation and measurement data for dementia care.  \n \nFunding: The UK Dementia Research Institute, Medical Research Council (MRC), Alzheimer's Society and Alzheimer's Research UK. \n \nDeclaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests. \n \nEthics Approval Statement: The study protocol for this work has been reviewed and approved by the South East Coast Surrey NHS Research Ethics Committee and all the research has been performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

        "title": "The Role of Explainability in Assuring Safety of Machine Learning in Healthcare",
        "abstract": "Established approaches to assuring safety-critical systems and software are difficult to apply to systems employing ML where there is no clear, pre-defined specification against which to assess validity. This problem is exacerbated by the “opaque” nature of ML where the learnt model is not amenable to human scrutiny. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue by producing human-interpretable representations of ML models which can help users to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system. However, little work explicitly investigates the role of explainability for safety assurance in the context of ML development. This paper identifies ways in which XAI methods can contribute to safety assurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete ML-based clinical decision support system, concerning weaning of patients from mechanical ventilation, to demonstrate how XAI methods can be employed to produce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented in a safety argument to show where, and in what way, XAI methods can contribute to a safety case. Overall, we conclude that XAI methods have a valuable role in safety assurance of ML-based systems in healthcare but that they are not sufficient in themselves to assure safety.",

        "title": "Improving HPC System Performance by Predicting Job Resources via Supervised Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems are resources utilized for data capture, sharing, and analysis. The majority of our HPC users come from other disciplines than Computer Science. HPC users including computer scientists have difficulties and do not feel proficient enough to decide the required amount of resources for their submitted jobs on the cluster. Consequently, users are encouraged to over-estimate resources for their submitted jobs, so their jobs will not be killing due insufficient resources. This process will waste and devour HPC resources; hence, this will lead to inefficient cluster utilization. We created a supervised machine learning model and integrated it into the Slurm resource manager simulator to predict the amount of required memory resources (Memory) and the required amount of time to run the computation. Our model involves using different machine learning algorithms. Our goal is to integrate and test the proposed supervised machine learning model on Slurm. We used over 10000 tasks selected from our HPC log files to evaluate the performance and the accuracy of our integrated model. The purpose of our work is to increase the performance of the Slurm by predicting the amount of require jobs memory resources and the time required for each particular job in order to improve the utilization of the HPC system using our integrated supervised machine learning model. Our results indicate that for larger jobs our model helps dramatically reduce computational turnaround time (from five days to ten hours for large jobs), substantially increased utilization of the HPC system, and decreased the average waiting time for the submitted jobs.",

        "title": "Dynamic Neural Graphs Based Federated Reptile for Semi-Supervised Multi-Tasking in Healthcare Applications",
        "abstract": "AI healthcare applications rely on sensitive electronic healthcare records (EHRs) that are scarcely labelled and are often distributed across a network of the symbiont institutions. It is challenging to train the effective machine learning models on such data. In this work, we propose dynamic neural graphs based federated learning framework to address these challenges. The proposed framework extends Reptile, a model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm, to a federated setting. However, unlike the existing MAML algorithms, this paper proposes a dynamic variant of neural graph learning (NGL) to incorporate unlabelled examples in the supervised training setup. Dynamic NGL computes a meta-learning update by performing supervised learning on a labelled training example while performing metric learning on its labelled or unlabelled neighbourhood. This neighbourhood of a labelled example is established dynamically using local graphs built over the batches of training examples. Each local graph is constructed by comparing the similarity between embedding generated by the current state of the model. The introduction of metric learning on the neighbourhood makes this framework semi-supervised in nature. The experimental results on the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both single and multi-task settings under data decentralisation constraints and limited supervision.",

        "title": "Uncovering Concerns of Citizens Through Machine Learning and Social Network Sentiment Analysis",
        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) as analytical tools can be applied across multiple social domains. Thus, these tools are being deployed in several ways to address societal issues and concerns for “social good”. For instance, AI/ML has applicable use cases for crisis response, economic empowerment, educational demands, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and hunger, and security and justice. In this work, we seek to explore the power and capability of AI/ML in understanding citizens’ engagement, which can improve governance and smart city deployment. Specifically, we studied the views expressed by online users about the city of Saskatoon in Canada. The analyzed views have become a value chain that community leaders can use to improve the governance structure of the city. In the study, we extracted 114,390 comments from Reddit (i.e., Saskatoon subreddit posts) between January 1, 2019, and September 20, 2023, to discover topics to highlight citizens’ concerns. We compare the performance of three major topic models, namely, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and BERTopic with a K-means clustering algorithm in the discovery of topics from the collected Reddit comments. The BERTopic with the K-means clustering algorithm achieved the highest coherence score of approximately 0.64 in the extraction of 25 topics from the dataset. Our findings showed that BERTopic can discover coherent and diverse topics compared to LDA and NMF. We found 12 underlying themes by merging related topics. Also, we leveraged SiEBERT (a pre-trained transformer model), 4 supervised ML models, and VADER (a lexical sentiment analysis classifier) to identify the sentiments expressed in each theme. The SiEBERT model outperformed the other sentiment classifiers with an accuracy of 89% in the prediction of sentiments. The research discovered factors for smart city engagement such as Housing and Facilities, Education, Downtown Development, Tourism and Entertainment, Policing, Healthcare, Online Community, and Cost.",

        "title": "Abstract 39: Development of a Hypoglycemia Prediction Model for Veterans With Diabetes Using Supervised Machine Learning Applied to Electronic Health Record Data",
        "abstract": "Accurate assessment of hypoglycemia risk is critical for treatment selection in individuals with diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) - patients for whom hypoglycemia is particularly harmful. We developed and validated a hypoglycemia prediction model in diabetes patients with and without CVD using data routinely available in electronic health records (EHR) and compared performance to a published prediction model. We studied 128,893 US Veterans with diabetes and angiographic assessment of CVD from 2005 to 2018. We used a random 2/3 of the sample for model development and the remaining 1/3 for validation. The primary outcome was severe hypoglycemia based on a previously validated algorithm that uses diagnosis codes and glucose measurements. We evaluated 33 potential predictors, including demographics, diabetes-related variables, comorbidities, and CVD risk factors. We sequentially used two machine learning algorithms for model development. First, we used multivariable adaptive regression splines, which can accommodate interactions and non-linearities for continuous variables, to select predictors. Second, we used adaptive elastic net, which can accommodate time-to-event outcomes, to fit a model with the selected variables. We tested model discrimination using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and calibration by plotting predicted versus observed event rates in the independent validation cohort. The best-fitting prediction model included 18 predictors; a history of hypoglycemia was the strongest predictor (Table). In external validation, AUC was 0.729 for 2-year events, and the slope of the calibration curve was 1.05, exceeding performance of the published model in this patient population for both discrimination and calibration (Table).\n \n Conclusions:\n Applying supervised machine learning to EHR data may provide an efficient approach to tailoring prediction of preventable clinical outcomes, e.g., hypoglycemia, for high risk patients receiving care in an integrated healthcare system.\n \n \n \n",

        "title": "Importance analysis of psychosociological variables in frailty syndrome in heart failure patients using machine learning approach",
        "abstract": "The prevention and diagnosis of frailty syndrome (FS) in cardiac patients requires innovative systems to support medical personnel, patient adherence, and self-care behavior. To do so, modern medicine uses a supervised machine learning approach (ML) to study the psychosocial domains of frailty in cardiac patients with heart failure (HF). This study aimed to determine the absolute and relative diagnostic importance of the individual components of the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) questionnaire in patients with HF. An exploratory analysis was performed using machine learning algorithms and the permutation method to determine the absolute importance of frailty components in HF. Based on the TFI data, which contain physical and psychosocial components, machine learning models were built based on three algorithms: a decision tree, a random decision forest, and the AdaBoost Models classifier. The absolute weights were used to make pairwise comparisons between the variables and obtain relative diagnostic importance. The analysis of HF patients’ responses showed that the psychological variable TFI20 diagnosing low mood was more diagnostically important than the variables from the physical domain: lack of strength in the hands and physical fatigue. The psychological variable TFI21 linked with agitation and irritability was diagnostically more important than all three physical variables considered: walking difficulties, lack of hand strength, and physical fatigue. In the case of the two remaining variables from the psychological domain (TFI19, TFI22), and for all variables from the social domain, the results do not allow for the rejection of the null hypothesis. From a long-term perspective, the ML based frailty approach can support healthcare professionals, including psychologists and social workers, in drawing their attention to the non-physical origins of HF.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide, with hypertension emerging as a significant risk factor. Early detection and treatment of hypertension can significantly reduce the risk of developing CVDs and related complications. This work proposes a novel approach employing features extracted from the acceleration photoplethysmography (APG) waveform, alongside clinical parameters, to estimate different stages of hypertension. The current study used a publicly available dataset and a novel feature extraction algorithm to extract APG waveform features. Three distinct supervised machine learning algorithms were employed in the classification task, namely: Decision Tree (DT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM). Results indicate that the DT model achieved exceptional training accuracy of 100% during cross-validation and maintained a high accuracy of 96.87% on the test dataset. The LDA model demonstrated competitive performance, yielding 85.02% accuracy during cross-validation and 84.37% on the test dataset. Meanwhile, the LSVM model exhibited robust accuracy, achieving 88.77% during cross-validation and 93.75% on the test dataset. These findings underscore the potential of APG analysis as a valuable tool for clinicians in estimating hypertension stages, supporting the need for early detection and intervention. This investigation not only advances hypertension risk assessment but also advocates for enhanced cardiovascular healthcare outcomes.",

        "abstract": "—Gastric Cancer (GC) diagnosis and prognosis present significant challenges in the clinical industry. To address the issue of low prediction accuracy resulting from imbalanced positive and negative GC cases, this study proposes a medical Decision Support System (DSS) based on supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods. Four ML models, including Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were employed in this study. The impact of data imbalance on GC prediction was assessed through two procedures. Among the ML models, the MLP model demonstrated the best performance in weighted GC prediction, achieving a sensitivity of 0.930 and a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 0.932 for balanced predictions, and a sensitivity of 0.918 and a PPV of 0.908 for unbalanced predictions. The NB model showed promise in handling the data imbalance issue, achieving a sensitivity of 0.722 and a PPV of 0.420 on the unbalanced dataset. Additionally, a DSS was developed specifically for the NB and LR models to improve prediction accuracy. The proposed method significantly improved the sensitivity of optimistic GC case prediction, with the Naïve Bayes model achieving a sensitivity of 0.936 and the Logistic Regression model achieving a sensitivity of 0.8306. These improvements enhance the reliability and efficiency of GC diagnostics, offering valuable decision support in healthcare. This research provides insights into addressing class imbalance in GC likelihood prediction and has potential implications for clinical practice",

        "title": "Efficient Automated Disease Diagnosis Using Machine Learning Models",
        "abstract": "Recently, many researchers have designed various automated diagnosis models using various supervised learning models. An early diagnosis of disease may control the death rate due to these diseases. In this paper, an efficient automated disease diagnosis model is designed using the machine learning models. In this paper, we have selected three critical diseases such as coronavirus, heart disease, and diabetes. In the proposed model, the data are entered into an android app, the analysis is then performed in a real-time database using a pretrained machine learning model which was trained on the same dataset and deployed in firebase, and finally, the disease detection result is shown in the android app. Logistic regression is used to carry out computation for prediction. Early detection can help in identifying the risk of coronavirus, heart disease, and diabetes. Comparative analysis indicates that the proposed model can help doctors to give timely medications for treatment.",

        "title": "Unsupervised machine learning for disease prediction: a comparative performance analysis using multiple datasets",
        "abstract": "Purpose Disease risk prediction poses a significant and growing challenge in the medical field. While researchers have increasingly utilised machine learning (ML) algorithms to tackle this issue, supervised ML methods remain dominant. However, there is a rising interest in unsupervised techniques, especially in situations where data labels might be missing — as seen with undiagnosed or rare diseases. This study delves into comparing unsupervised ML models for disease prediction. Methods This study evaluated the efficacy of seven unsupervised algorithms on 15 datasets, including those of heart failure, diabetes, and breast cancer. It used six performance metrics for this comparison. They are Adjusted Rand Index, Adjusted Mutual Information, Homogeneity, Completeness, V-measure and Silhouette Coefficient. Results Among the seven unsupervised ML methods, the DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) showed the best performance most times (31), followed by the Bayesian Gaussian Mixture (18) and Divisive clustering (15). No single model consistently outshined others across every dataset and metric. The study emphasises the crucial role of model and performance measure selections based on application-specific needs. For example, DBSCAN excels in Homogeneity, Completeness and V-measure metrics. Conversely, the Bayesian Gaussian Mixture is good in the Adjusted R and Index metric. The codes used in this study can be found at https://github.com/haohuilu/unsupervisedml/ . Conclusion This research contributes deeper insights into the unsupervised ML applications in healthcare and encourages further investigations into model selection. Subsequent studies could harness genuine disease records for a more nuanced comparison and evaluation of models.",

        "abstract": "Objective This study aimed to develop and validate predictive models using electronic health records (EHR) data to determine whether hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients would be admitted to alternative medical care or discharged home. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using deidentified data from the University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository. The study included 1,578 adult patients (≥18 years) who tested positive for COVID-19 while hospitalized, comprising 960 (60.8%) female patients with a mean (SD) age of 51.86 (18.49) years and 618 (39.2%) male patients with a mean (SD) age of 54.35 (18.48) years. Machine learning (ML) model training involved cross-validation to assess their performance in predicting patient disposition. Results We developed and validated six supervised ML-based prediction models (logistic regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forest, and support vector machine classifier) to predict patient discharge status. The models were evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), precision, accuracy, F1 score, and Brier score. The random forest classifier exhibited the highest performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.84 and an AUC of 0.72. Logistic regression (accuracy: 0.85, AUC: 0.71), k-nearest neighbor (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.63), decision tree (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.61), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.66), and support vector machine classifier (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.67) also demonstrated valuable predictive capabilities. Significance This study’s findings are crucial for efficiently allocating healthcare resources during pandemics like COVID-19. By harnessing ML techniques and EHR data, we can create predictive tools to identify patients at greater risk of severe symptoms based on their medical histories. The models developed here serve as a foundation for expanding the toolkit available to healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, explainable ML methods, such as Shapley Additive Explanations, aid in uncovering underlying data features that inform healthcare decision-making processes.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization labelled the new COVID-19 breakout a public health crisis of worldwide concern on 30 January 2020, and it was named the new global pandemic in March 2020. It has had catastrophic consequences on the world economy and well-being of people and has put a tremendous strain on already-scarce healthcare systems globally, particularly in underdeveloped countries. Over 11 billion vaccine doses have already been administered worldwide, and the benefits of these vaccinations will take some time to appear. Today, the only practical approach to diagnosing COVID-19 is through the RT-PCR and RAT tests, which have sometimes been known to give unreliable results. Timely diagnosis and implementation of precautionary measures will likely improve the survival outcome and decrease the fatality rates. In this study, we propose an innovative way to predict COVID-19 with the help of alternative non-clinical methods such as supervised machine learning models to identify the patients at risk based on their characteristic parameters and underlying comorbidities. Medical records of patients from Mexico admitted between 23 January 2020 and 26 March 2022, were chosen for this purpose. Among several supervised machine learning approaches tested, the XGBoost model achieved the best results with an accuracy of 92%. It is an easy, non-invasive, inexpensive, instant and accurate way of forecasting those at risk of contracting the virus. However, it is pretty early to deduce that this method can be used as an alternative in the clinical diagnosis of coronavirus cases.",

        "title": "Developing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Based Diagnosis System for Diabetes Mellitus using Interpretable Techniques",
        "abstract": "Diabetes is a major global health issue that affects multiple bodily components and contributes to millions of deaths each year. Traditional approaches to diabetes diagnosis and treatment are often limited by their lack of accuracy, transparency, and efficiency. This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel machine learning-based diagnosis system for diabetes mellitus using interpretable supervised and neural network techniques. The study used a dataset of 9 features listed in 2000 patient information from The Frankfurt Hospital, Germany, and trained and tested several ML algorithms including logistic regression, gradient boosting, naive Bayes classifier, random forest classifier, and artificial neural network (ANN). The performance of each algorithm was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score, and the findings indicate that the ANN model performs best with a larger number of features, achieving 100% accuracy. Interpretable techniques were used to facilitate understanding of the ML model decision-making process. The suggested system offers several implications and potential impacts on healthcare practice, including improved diagnosis accuracy, automation of diabetes testing and referral algorithms, and reduced time, work, and labor in medical services. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning to address the limitations of traditional diabetes diagnosis and treatment, and contribute to better patient outcomes.",

        "title": "A review of supervised machine learning applied to ageing research",
        "abstract": "Broadly speaking, supervised machine learning is the computational task of learning correlations between variables in annotated data (the training set), and using this information to create a predictive model capable of inferring annotations for new data, whose annotations are not known. Ageing is a complex process that affects nearly all animal species. This process can be studied at several levels of abstraction, in different organisms and with different objectives in mind. Not surprisingly, the diversity of the supervised machine learning algorithms applied to answer biological questions reflects the complexities of the underlying ageing processes being studied. Many works using supervised machine learning to study the ageing process have been recently published, so it is timely to review these works, to discuss their main findings and weaknesses. In summary, the main findings of the reviewed papers are: the link between specific types of DNA repair and ageing; ageing-related proteins tend to be highly connected and seem to play a central role in molecular pathways; ageing/longevity is linked with autophagy and apoptosis, nutrient receptor genes, and copper and iron ion transport. Additionally, several biomarkers of ageing were found by machine learning. Despite some interesting machine learning results, we also identified a weakness of current works on this topic: only one of the reviewed papers has corroborated the computational results of machine learning algorithms through wet-lab experiments. In conclusion, supervised machine learning has contributed to advance our knowledge and has provided novel insights on ageing, yet future work should have a greater emphasis in validating the predictions.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 global pandemic is a threat not only to the health of millions of individuals, but also to the stability of infrastructure and economies around the world. The disease will inevitably place an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems that cannot be effectively dealt with by existing facilities or responses based on conventional approaches. We believe that a rigorous clinical and societal response can only be mounted by using intelligence derived from a variety of data sources to better utilize scarce healthcare resources, provide personalized patient management plans, inform policy, and expedite clinical trials. In this paper, we introduce five of the most important challenges in responding to COVID-19 and show how each of them can be addressed by recent developments in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that the integration of these techniques into local, national, and international healthcare systems will save lives, and propose specific methods by which implementation can happen swiftly and efficiently. We offer to extend these resources and knowledge to assist policymakers seeking to implement these techniques.",

        "title": "Efficient Representation Learning for Healthcare with Cross-Architectural Self-Supervision",
        "abstract": "In healthcare and biomedical applications, extreme computational requirements pose a significant barrier to adopting representation learning. Representation learning can enhance the performance of deep learning architectures by learning useful priors from limited medical data. However, state-of-the-art self-supervised techniques suffer from reduced performance when using smaller batch sizes or shorter pretraining epochs, which are more practical in clinical settings. We present Cross Architectural - Self Supervision (CASS) in response to this challenge. This novel siamese self-supervised learning approach synergistically leverages Transformer and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for efficient learning. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CASS-trained CNNs and Transformers outperform existing self-supervised learning methods across four diverse healthcare datasets. With only 1% labeled data for finetuning, CASS achieves a 3.8% average improvement; with 10% labeled data, it gains 5.9%; and with 100% labeled data, it reaches a remarkable 10.13% enhancement. Notably, CASS reduces pretraining time by 69% compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it more amenable to clinical implementation. We also demonstrate that CASS is considerably more robust to variations in batch size and pretraining epochs, making it a suitable candidate for machine learning in healthcare applications.",

        "title": "Machine Learning Based Framework for Maintaining Privacy of Healthcare Data",
        "abstract": "The Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud services, web-based software systems, and other wireless sensor devices in the healthcare infrastructure have led to phenomenal improvements and benefits in the healthcare sector. Digital healthcare has ensured early diagnosis of the diseases, greater accessibility, and mass outreach in terms of treatment. Despite this unprecedented success, the privacy and confidentiality of the healthcare data have become a major concern for all the stakeholders. Data breach reports reveal that the healthcare data industry is one of the key targets of cyber invaders. In fact the last few years have registered an unprecedented rise in healthcare data breaches. Hacking incidents and privilege abuse are the most common threats and have exposed sensitive and protected health data. Experts and researchers are working on various techniques, tools, and methods to address the security issues related to healthcare data. In this article, the main focus is on evaluating the impact of research studies done in the context of healthcare data breach reports to identify the contemporary privacy and confidentiality issues of sensitive healthcare data. Analysis of the research studies depicts that there is a need for proactive security mechanisms that will help the healthcare organizations to identify abnormal user behavior while accessing healthcare data. Moreover, studies also suggest that ML techniques would be highly effective in securing the privacy and confidentiality of the healthcare data. Working further on this premise, the present study also proposes a conceptual framework that will secure the privacy and confidentiality of healthcare data proactively. The proposed framework is based on ML techniques to detect deviated user access against Electronic Health Records. Further, fuzzy-based Analytical Network Process (ANP), a multi-criteria decision-making approach, is used to assess the accuracy of the supervised and unsupervised ML approaches for achieving a dynamic digital healthcare data security environment.

        "title": "Data Shapley: Equitable Valuation of Data for Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "As data becomes the fuel driving technological and economic growth, a fundamental challenge is how to quantify the value of data in algorithmic predictions and decisions. For example, in healthcare and consumer markets, it has been suggested that individuals should be compensated for the data that they generate, but it is not clear what is an equitable valuation for individual data. In this work, we develop a principled framework to address data valuation in the context of supervised machine learning. Given a learning algorithm trained on $n$ data points to produce a predictor, we propose data Shapley as a metric to quantify the value of each training datum to the predictor performance. Data Shapley value uniquely satisfies several natural properties of equitable data valuation. We develop Monte Carlo and gradient-based methods to efficiently estimate data Shapley values in practical settings where complex learning algorithms, including neural networks, are trained on large datasets. In addition to being equitable, extensive experiments across biomedical, image and synthetic data demonstrate that data Shapley has several other benefits: 1) it is more powerful than the popular leave-one-out or leverage score in providing insight on what data is more valuable for a given learning task; 2) low Shapley value data effectively capture outliers and corruptions; 3) high Shapley value data inform what type of new data to acquire to improve the predictor.",

        "abstract": "Detrimental online behavior such as harassment and cyberbullying is becoming a serious, large-scale problem damaging people’s lives. This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such behaviors. We propose a machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). We evaluate PVC on three social media data sets, demonstrating quantitatively and qualitatively its effectiveness in cyberbullying detection.",

        "title": "Reduction of Biosensor False Responses and Time Delay Using Dynamic Response and Theory-Guided Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Here, we provide a new methodology for reducing false results and time delay of biosensors, which are barriers to industrial, healthcare, military, and consumer applications. We show that integrating machine learning with domain knowledge in biosensing can complement and improve the biosensor accuracy and speed relative to the performance achieved by traditional regression analysis of a standard curve based on the biosensor steady-state response. The methodology was validated by rapid and accurate quantification of microRNA across the nanomolar to femtomolar range using the dynamic response of cantilever biosensors. Theory-guided feature engineering improved the performance and efficiency of several classification models relative to the performance achieved using traditional feature engineering methods (TSFRESH). In addition to the entire dynamic response, the technique enabled rapid and accurate quantification of the target analyte concentration and false-positive and false-negative results using the initial transient response, thereby reducing the required data acquisition time (i.e., time delay). We show that model explainability can be achieved by combining theory-guided feature engineering and feature importance analysis. The performance of multiple classifiers using both TSFRESH- and theory-based features from the biosensor’s initial transient response was similar to that achieved using the entire dynamic response with data augmentation. We also show that the methodology can guide design of experiments for high-performance biosensing applications, specifically, the selection of data acquisition parameters (e.g., time) based on potential application-dependent performance thresholds. This work provides an example of the opportunities for improving biosensor performance, such as reducing biosensor false results and time delay, using explainable machine learning models supervised by domain knowledge in biosensing.",

        "title": "Machine Learning-Based Detection of Dengue from Blood Smear Images Utilizing Platelet and Lymphocyte Characteristics",
        "abstract": "Dengue fever, also known as break-bone fever, can be life-threatening. Caused by DENV, an RNA virus from the Flaviviridae family, dengue is currently a globally important public health problem. The clinical methods available for dengue diagnosis require skilled supervision. They are manual, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not affordable to common people. This paper describes a method that can support clinicians during dengue diagnosis. It is proposed to automate the peripheral blood smear (PBS) examination using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid dengue diagnosis. Nowadays, AI, especially Machine Learning (ML), is increasingly being explored for successful analyses in the biomedical field. Digital pathology coupled with AI holds great potential in developing healthcare services. The automation system developed incorporates a blob detection method to detect platelets and thrombocytopenia from the PBS images. The results achieved are clinically acceptable. Moreover, an ML-based technique is proposed to detect dengue from the images of PBS based on the lymphocyte nucleus. Ten features are extracted, including six morphological and four Gray Level Spatial Dependance Matrix (GLSDM) features, out of the lymphocyte nucleus of normal and dengue cases. Features are then subjected to various popular supervised classifiers built using a ten-fold cross-validation policy for automated dengue detection. Among all the classifiers, the best performance was achieved by Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), each with an accuracy of 93.62%. Furthermore, 1000 deep features extracted using pre-trained MobileNetV2 and 177 textural features extracted using Local binary pattern (LBP) from the lymphocyte nucleus are subjected to feature selection. The ReliefF selected 100 most significant features are then fed to the classifiers. The best performance was attained using an SVM classifier with 95.74% accuracy. With the obtained results, it is evident that this proposed approach can efficiently contribute as an adjuvant tool for diagnosing dengue from the digital microscopic images of PBS.",

        "abstract": "In cancer diagnostics, a considerable amount of data is acquired during routine work-up. Recently, machine learning has been used to build classifiers that are tasked with cancer detection and aid in clinical decision-making. Most of these classifiers are based on supervised learning (SL) that needs time- and cost-intensive manual labeling of samples by medical experts for model training. Semi-supervised learning (SSL), however, works with only a fraction of labeled data by including unlabeled samples for information abstraction and thus can utilize the vast discrepancy between available labeled data and overall available data in cancer diagnostics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of essential functionalities and assumptions of SSL and survey key studies with regard to cancer care differentiating between image-based and non-image-based applications. We highlight current state-of-the-art models in histopathology, radiology and radiotherapy, as well as genomics. Further, we discuss potential pitfalls in SSL study design such as discrepancies in data distributions and comparison to baseline SL models, and point out future directions for SSL in oncology. We believe well-designed SSL models to strongly contribute to computer-guided diagnostics in malignant disease by overcoming current hinderances in the form of sparse labeled and abundant unlabeled data.",

        "title": "Method for Classifying Schizophrenia Patients Based on Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects individuals in various ways, particularly in their ability to perceive, process, and respond to stimuli. This condition has a significant impact on a considerable number of individuals. Consequently, the study, analysis, and characterization of this pathology are of paramount importance. Electroencephalography (EEG) is frequently utilized in the diagnostic assessment of various brain disorders due to its non-intrusiveness, excellent resolution and ease of placement. However, the manual analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings can be a complex and time-consuming task for healthcare professionals. Therefore, the automated analysis of EEG recordings can help alleviate the burden on doctors and provide valuable insights to support clinical diagnosis. Many studies are working along these lines. In this research paper, the authors propose a machine learning (ML) method based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm for analyzing EEG signals. The study compares the performance of the proposed XGB-based approach with four other supervised ML systems. According to the results, the proposed XGB-based method demonstrates superior performance, with an AUC value of 0.94 and an accuracy value of 0.94, surpassing the other compared methods. The implemented system exhibits high accuracy and robustness in accurately classifying schizophrenia patients based on EEG recordings. This method holds the potential to be implemented as a valuable complementary tool for clinical use in hospitals, supporting clinicians in their clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "The application of business intelligence (BI) in data analytics helps organizations access critical information in finance, marketing, healthcare, retail, and other critical infrastructures. However, there is a dearth of strategies to effectively leverage BI to empower businesses to refine useful data, understand newer industry trends, and improve competitive intelligence strategy for effective decision-making. This study implemented predictive data analytics to determine how the subjective decision-making process of used dealerships conducts their sales of vehicles and other business variable decisions. Scouring over forty-five different aspects of typical vehicle items, the study randomly selected twelve (12) features considered important. The data points were classified on the machine learning algorithms using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to find the hyperplane of the (N-dimensional) features number for the training supervision of the dataset, while the Contingency Table Method (CTM) summarizes the relationship between the variables in the frequency distribution table. When six variables were outlined for comparison in the frequency distribution table, The models with optimal hyper-parameters showed similar predictive performances for all predictions while the “support vector regression algorithm” performs best with a strong output of 85% prediction analytics at a specific time of when certified used vehicles would be sold within a specified period. Consequentially, the extrapolative accuracy of the traditional decision-making process, when compared showed relative statistics of just around 50%. The study concludes that implementing business intelligence (BI) using machine learning models for predictive data analytics leads to increased revenue, effective customer satisfaction, an increase in market share, and improved decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), heart disease, acknowledged as the most common cause of death during the preceding several decades, is now recognized as the most lethal condition, not just in India but throughout the globe. In humans, the heart is important. A small error can result in tiredness issues or even death. One of the most significant challenges confronting medical sector today is the prediction or forecasting of heart illness. It is associated with numerous and intimidating factors and components. An early diagnosis must be made using a prediction model that is reliable, trustworthy, and reasonable in order to achieve rapid disease treatment. It has been discovered that machine learning may help with decision-making and prediction-making using the vast amounts of data that gathered from several healthcare firms. Machine learning methods and approaches have been used to automate the study of big and complicated medical information. Recently, some researchers have employed various machine learning to assist the healthcare sectors and professionals to identify heart- related illness. Represented research evaluates the effectiveness of multiple models built based on supervised machine learning techniques and schemes such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). The ultimate goal of the presented study is to foretell which individuals having heartdisease based on particular attributes. The result of the proposed model demonstrates that the Random Forest Algorithm has the highest accuracy rating.",

        "abstract": "Coronary Artery Disease is the type of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that happens when the blood vessels which stream the blood toward the heart, either become tapered or blocked. Of this, the heart is incapable to push sufficient blood to encounter its requirements. This would lead to angina (chest pain). CVDs are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. According to WHO, in the year 2019 17.9 million people deceased from CVD. Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to help analyse large datasets more efficiently. It can be used in medical research to help process large amounts of data quickly, such as patient records or medical images. By using Machine Learning techniques and methods, scientists can automate the analysis of complex and large datasets to gain deeper insights into the data. Machine Learning is a type of technology that helps with gathering data and understanding patterns. Recently, researchers in the healthcare industry have been using Machine Learning techniques to assist with diagnosing heart-related diseases. This means that the professionals involved in the diagnosis process can use Machine Learning to help them figure out what is wrong with a patient and provide appropriate treatment. This paper evaluates different machine learning models performances. The Supervised Learning algorithms are used commonly in Machine Learning which means that the training is done using labelled data, belonging to a particular classification. Such classification methods like Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour, XGBoost algorithm, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine will be used to assess the cardiovascular disease by Machine Learning.",

        "title": "Machine learning models applied to predicate post activity oxygen saturation levels",
        "abstract": "Machine learning is a rapidly growing field with widespread application in various industries, including healthcare. In recent years, significant advancements in machine learning have enhanced our understanding of data analytics and prediction models in analyzing physiological data, such as blood oxygen levels, heart rate, and blood pressure. This paper focuses on physical activity in adolescence during the pandemic period. The study showed that going outside for a short walk can increase blood oxygen levels. Furthermore, the consumption of certain foods can also raise oxygen saturation levels. Maintaining a high blood oxygen level during exercise can improve athletic performance and reduce injury risk. However, during exercise, the blood oxygen level tends to decrease as the heart rate increases to supply more oxygen to the body. When the blood oxygen level drops too low during exercise, it can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and even fainting. By tracking heartbeats, blood oxygen levels, and other physiological parameters during exercise with the YAMAY Smart Watch wearable device, individuals can gain insights into their body's response to physical activity and adjust their exercise routine accordingly. After collecting data using wearable devices and mobile apps, machine learning algorithms can be trained to predict changes in physiological parameters of post-activity, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of different exercises and identifying potential health risks. Our study used supervised machine learning classification algorithms to predict the expected data with the target data. We used K-fold cross-validation techniques to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for the supervised machine learning classification algorithms. After testing each of the machine learning models (K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest), it was found that the Random Forest had the best prediction accuracy of 98.75%. On the other hand, KNN had a poor prediction accuracy, lower than 41.1%. Therefore, the Random Forest model can accurately predict the effect of change on the oxygen saturation level during exercise.",

        "abstract": "Clinical image retrieval plays a pivotal role in modern healthcare for diagnostics and research, but prior research has grappled with the challenge of achieving high accuracy due to limited filtering techniques. The proposed method includes statistical distance measurements for similarity comparison and a machine learning technique for image filtering. Throughout this framework, the search area for similarity matching is reduced by first filtering away irrelevant images using the probabilistic outcomes of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification as class predictions of search and database images. Resizing is done as part of the preprocessing. Then, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the preprocessed data’s textural features, visual characteristics, and low-level features are extracted. The study also suggested an adaptive similarity matching method centered on a linear integration of feature-level similarities on the individual-level level. The precision and ranking order details of the most appropriate images retrieved and predicted by SVMs are considered when calculating the feature weights. The system continually alters weights for every distinctive search to generate beneficial outcomes. The supervised and unsupervised learning strategies are studied to link low-level global image features in the generated PCA-based Eigen Space using their high-level semantic and visual classifications to reduce the semantic gap and enhance retrieval effectiveness. The ground-truth database used in experiments has 1594 unique medical images with 3 different databases. Our method significantly improves the precision and recall rates in image retrieval tasks by combining sophisticated feature extraction, data-driven algorithms, and deep learning models. Research obtained an impressive accuracy of 0.99, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This novel methodology addresses the limitations of prior research and provides a robust and reliable solution for clinicians and researchers in the medical field seeking to access and analyze relevant clinical images.",

In contrast to traditional supervised learning that typically relies on one-shot, exhaustive, and supervised reward signals, RL tackles sequential decision-making problems with sampled, evaluative, and delayed feedbacks simultaneously. Such a distinctive feature makes RL techniques a suitable candidate for developing powerful solutions in various healthcare domains, where diagnosing decisions or treatment regimes are usually characterized by a prolonged period with delayed feedbacks. By first briefly examining theoretical foundations and key methods in RL research, this survey provides an extensive overview of RL applications in a variety of healthcare domains, ranging from dynamic treatment regimes in chronic diseases and critical care, automated medical diagnosis, and many other control or scheduling problems that have infiltrated every aspect of the healthcare system. In addition, we discuss the challenges and open issues in the current research and highlight some potential solutions and directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "A key task of emergency departments is to promptly identify patients who require hospital admission. Early identification ensures patient safety and aids organisational planning. Supervised machine learning algorithms can use data describing historical episodes to make ahead-of-time predictions of clinical outcomes. Despite this, clinical settings are dynamic environments and the underlying data distributions characterising episodes can change with time (data drift), and so can the relationship between episode characteristics and associated clinical outcomes (concept drift). Practically this means deployed algorithms must be monitored to ensure their safety. We demonstrate how explainable machine learning can be used to monitor data drift, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a severe example. We present a machine learning classifier trained using (pre-COVID-19) data, to identify patients at high risk of admission during an emergency department attendance. We then evaluate our model’s performance on attendances occurring pre-pandemic (AUROC of 0.856 with 95%CI [0.852, 0.859]) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (AUROC of 0.826 with 95%CI [0.814, 0.837]). We demonstrate two benefits of explainable machine learning (SHAP) for models deployed in healthcare settings: (1) By tracking the variation in a feature’s SHAP value relative to its global importance, a complimentary measure of data drift is found which highlights the need to retrain a predictive model. (2) By observing the relative changes in feature importance emergent health risks can be identified.",

        "abstract": "Data-driven model with predictive ability are important to be used in medical and healthcare. However, the most challenging task in predictive modeling is to construct a prediction model, which can be addressed using machine learning (ML) methods. The methods are used to learn and trained the model using a gene expression dataset without being programmed explicitly. Due to the vast amount of gene expression data, this task becomes complex and time consuming. This paper provides a recent review on recent progress in ML and deep learning (DL) for cancer classification, which has received increasing attention in bioinformatics and computational biology. The development of cancer classification methods based on ML and DL is mostly focused on this review. Although many methods have been applied to the cancer classification problem, recent progress shows that most of the successful techniques are those based on supervised and DL methods. In addition, the sources of the healthcare dataset are also described. The development of many machine learning methods for insight analysis in cancer classification has brought a lot of improvement in healthcare. Currently, it seems that there is highly demanded further development of efficient classification methods to address the expansion of healthcare applications.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications in smart regions/cities, for example, smart healthcare, smart homes/offices, there is an increase in security threats and risks. The IoT devices solve real-world problems by providing real-time connections, data and information. Besides this, the attackers can tamper with sensors, add or remove them physically or remotely. In this study, we address the IoT security sensor tampering issue in an office environment. We collect data from real-life settings and apply machine learning to detect sensor tampering using two methods. First, a real-time view of the traffic patterns is considered to train our isolation forest-based unsupervised machine learning method for anomaly detection. Second, based on traffic patterns, labels are created, and the decision tree supervised method is used, within our novel Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning (AD-ML) system. The accuracy of the two proposed models is presented. We found 84% with silhouette metric accuracy of isolation forest. Moreover, the result based on 10 cross-validations for decision trees on the supervised machine learning model returned the highest classification accuracy of 91.62% with the lowest false positive rate.",

        "title": "Personalized Machine Learning using Passive Sensing and Ecological Momentary Assessments for Meth Users in Hawaii: A Research Protocol",
        "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital therapies which detect meth cravings delivered on consumer devices have the potential to reduce these disparities by providing remote and accessible care solutions to Native Hawaiians, Filipinos, and Pacific Islanders (NHFPI) communities with limited care solutions. However, NHFPI are fully understudied with respect to digital therapeutics and AI health sensing despite using technology at the same rates as other races. Objective: We seek to fulfill two research aims: (1) Understand the feasibility of continuous remote digital monitoring and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) in NHFPI in Hawaii by curating a novel dataset of longitudinal FitBit biosignals with corresponding craving and substance use labels. (2) Develop personalized AI models which predict meth craving events in real time using wearable sensor data. Methods: We will develop personalized AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning) models for meth use and craving prediction in 40 NHFPI individuals by curating a novel dataset of real-time FitBit biosensor readings and corresponding participant annotations (i.e., raw self-reported substance use data) of their meth use and cravings. In the process of collecting this dataset, we will glean insights about cultural and other human factors which can challenge the proper acquisition of precise annotations. With the resulting dataset, we will employ self-supervised learning (SSL) AI approaches, which are a new family of ML methods that allow a neural network to be trained without labels by being optimized to make predictions about the data itself. The inputs to the proposed AI models are FitBit biosensor readings and the outputs are predictions of meth use or craving. This paradigm is gaining increased attention in AI for healthcare. Conclusions: We expect to develop models which significantly outperform traditional supervised methods by fine-tuning to an individual subject's data. Such methods will enable AI solutions which work with the limited data available from NHFPI populations and which are inherently unbiased due to their personalized nature. Such models can support future AI-powered digital therapeutics for substance abuse.",

        "title": "Machine learning algorithms for the prognostication of abdominal aortic aneurysm progression: a systematic review.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), often characterized by an abdominal aortic diameter over 3.0 cm, is managed through screening, surveillance, and surgical intervention. AAA growth can be heterogeneous and rupture carries a high mortality rate, with size and certain risk factors influencing rupture risk. Research is ongoing to accurately predict individual AAA growth rates for personalized management. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has shown promise in various medical fields, including endoleak detection post-EVAR. However, its application for predicting AAA growth remains insufficiently explored, thus necessitating further investigation. Subsequently, this paper aims to summarize the current status of machine learning in predicting AAA growth.\n\n\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION\nA systematic database search of Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane, PubMed and Google Scholar from inception till December 2022 was conducted of original articles that discussed the use of machine learning in predicting AAA growth using the aforementioned databases.\n\n\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS\nOverall, 2742 articles were extracted, of which seven retrospective studies involving 410 patients were included using a predetermined criteria. Six out of seven studies applied a supervised learning approach for their machine learning (ML) models, with considerable diversity observed within specific ML models. The majority of the studies concluded that machine learning models perform better in predicting AAA growth in comparison to reference models. All studies focused on predicting AAA growth over specified durations. Maximal luminal diameter was the most frequently used indicator, with alternative predictors being AAA volume, ILT (intraluminal thrombus) and flow-medicated diameter (FMD).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe nascent field of applying machine learning (ML) for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) expansion prediction exhibits potential to enhance predictive accuracy across diverse parameters. Future studies must emphasize evidencing clinical utility in a healthcare system context, thereby ensuring patient outcome improvement. This will necessitate addressing key ethical implications in establishing prospective studies related to this topic and collaboration among pivotal stakeholders within the AI field.",

        "title": "Point break: using machine learning to uncover a critical mass in women's representation",
        "abstract": "Abstract Decades of research has debated whether women first need to reach a “critical mass” in the legislature before they can effectively influence legislative outcomes. This study contributes to the debate using supervised tree-based machine learning to study the relationship between increasing variation in women's legislative representation and the allocation of government expenditures in three policy areas: education, healthcare, and defense. We find that women's representation predicts spending in all three areas. We also find evidence of critical mass effects as the relationships between women's representation and government spending are nonlinear. However, beyond critical mass, our research points to a potential critical mass interval or critical limit point in women's representation. We offer guidance on how these results can inform future research using standard parametric models.",

        "title": "Impact of the Choice of Cross-Validation Techniques on the Results of Machine Learning-Based Diagnostic Applications",
        "abstract": "Objectives With advances in data availability and computing capabilities, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have evolved rapidly in recent years. Researchers have taken advantage of these developments in healthcare informatics and created reliable tools to predict or classify diseases using machine learning-based algorithms. To correctly quantify the performance of those algorithms, the standard approach is to use cross-validation, where the algorithm is trained on a training set, and its performance is measured on a validation set. Both datasets should be subject-independent to simulate the expected behavior of a clinical study. This study compares two cross-validation strategies, the subject-wise and the record-wise techniques; the subject-wise strategy correctly mimics the process of a clinical study, while the record-wise strategy does not. Methods We started by creating a dataset of smartphone audio recordings of subjects diagnosed with and without Parkinson’s disease. This dataset was then divided into training and holdout sets using subject-wise and the record-wise divisions. The training set was used to measure the performance of two classifiers (support vector machine and random forest) to compare six cross-validation techniques that simulated either the subject-wise process or the record-wise process. The holdout set was used to calculate the true error of the classifiers. Results The record-wise division and the record-wise cross-validation techniques overestimated the performance of the classifiers and underestimated the classification error. Conclusions In a diagnostic scenario, the subject-wise technique is the proper way of estimating a model’s performance, and record-wise techniques should be avoided.",

        "abstract": "Background Hospice and palliative care (HPC) aims to improve end-of-life quality and has received much more attention through the lens of an aging population in the midst of the coronavirus disease pandemic. However, several barriers remain in China due to a lack of professional HPC providers with positive behavioral intentions. Therefore, we conducted an original study introducing machine learning to explore individual behavioral intentions and detect factors of enablers of, and barriers to, excavating potential human resources and improving HPC accessibility. Methods A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate healthcare providers' behavioral intentions, knowledge, attitudes, and practices in hospice care (KAPHC) with an indigenized KAPHC scale. Binary Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) were performed to model impacting and predict individual behavioral intentions. Results The RFC showed high sensitivity (accuracy = 0.75; F1 score = 0.84; recall = 0.94). Attitude could directly or indirectly improve work enthusiasm and is the most efficient approach to reveal behavioral intentions. Continuous practice could also improve individual confidence and willingness to provide HPC. In addition, scientific knowledge and related skills were the foundation of implementing HPC. Conclusion Individual behavioral intention is crucial for improving HPC accessibility, particularly at the initial stage. A well-trained RFC can help estimate individual behavioral intentions to organize a productive team and promote additional policies.",

Hospitals and other clinics are offering expensive therapies and operations to treat heart diseases. So, predicting heart disease at the early stages will be useful to the people around the world so that they will take necessary actions before getting severe. Heart disease is a significant problem in recent times; the main reason for this disease is the intake of alcohol, tobacco, and lack of physical exercise. Over the years, machine learning shows effective results in making decisions and predictions from the broad set of data produced by the health care industry. Some of the supervised machine learning techniques used in this prediction of heart disease are artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), naïve Bayes) (NB) and k-nearest neighbour algorithm.

        "title": "Multimodal machine learning for analysing multifactorial causes of disease—The case of childhood overweight and obesity in Mexico",
        "abstract": "Background Mexico has one of the highest global incidences of paediatric overweight and obesity. Public health interventions have shown only moderate success, possibly from relying on knowledge extracted using limited types of statistical data analysis methods. Purpose To explore if multimodal machine learning can enhance identifying predictive features from obesogenic environments and investigating complex disease or social patterns, using the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey. Methods We grouped features into five data modalities corresponding to paediatric population exogenous factors, in two multimodal machine learning pipelines, against a unimodal early fusion baseline. The supervised pipeline employed four methods: Linear classifier with Elastic Net regularisation, k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The unsupervised pipeline used traditional methods with k-Means and hierarchical clustering, with the optimal number of clusters calculated to be k = 2. Results The decision tree classifier in the supervised early fusion approach produced the best quantitative results. The top five most important features for classifying child or adolescent health were measures of an adult in the household, selected at random: BMI, obesity diagnosis, being single, seeking care at private healthcare, and having paid TV in the home. Unsupervised learning approaches varied in the optimal number of clusters but agreed on the importance of home environment features when analysing inter-cluster patterns. Main findings from this study differed from previous studies using only traditional statistical methods on the same database. Notably, the BMI of a randomised adult within the household emerged as the most important feature, rather than maternal BMI, as reported in previous literature where unwanted cultural bias went undetected. Conclusion Our general conclusion is that multimodal machine learning is a promising approach for comprehensively analysing obesogenic environments. The modalities allowed for a multimodal approach designed to critically analyse data signal strength and reveal sources of unwanted bias. In particular, it may aid in developing more effective public health policies to address the ongoing paediatric obesity epidemic in Mexico.",

        "abstract": "The number of insurgents in our nation today is significantly rising each day, and the majority of those affected are living as Internally Displayed Persons (IDP) in various IDP camps. These people experience a variety of health problems as a result of numerous factors. Due to financial difficulties and a lack of accessibility to healthcare facilities and medical professionals, these health risk factors may occasionally go undetected for long periods. BMI excesses, such as those in the underweight, overweight, and obese categories, are linked to several health issues, including low birth weight, poor quality of life, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and higher mortality. In the context of this paper, identifying the health status of IDPs depends critically on human body weight. For people living in IDP camps, early detection of the weight categories like underweight, overweight, and obese people is crucial because if not, they will be an early death or other health complications. To reduce mortality rates and other health complications that may result from improper and lately identifying underweight, overweight, and obese members in IDP camps, the researcher collect Datasets from the IDP camps, trained, and developed a Random Forest ensemble model of supervised learning that will aids the medical practitioner in early detection and prediction of the weight category of IDPs. After hyper-parameter tuning and feature selection, the Random forest machine learning algorithms identify three significant parameters from the dataset's original 10 parameters to use as the model parameter. The highest accuracy obtained was 92% on the test dataset and 96% on the training dataset for the Random Forest (RF) Classifier using 3 features, while the accuracy of 83% was obtained on the test dataset and 87% on the training dataset for the RF Classifier using 10 features.",

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a serious medical condition. Currently, the healthcare system employs a number of techniques to identify osteoporosis at an early stage. However, these techniques are damaging to skin and tissue, ineffective economically, and difficult to carry around. Microwaves have become more widely used in the medical field recently. It is a non-ionizing, non-invasive method that causes minor tissue damage. Previously, the Bone Health Analyser was designed using a microstrip patch antenna for frequencies ranging from 3GHz to 8GHz, and it was discovered that at lower frequencies, the transfer characteristics of the antenna for different bones are more distinct and easier to classify. Thus, in this paper, microwave signal ranging from 1.5GHz to 4.5GHz is transmitted from a Bow-Tie antenna, and a change in attenuation of the signal is received at another Bow - tie antenna. The simulated signal attenuation (S21) is recorded as it passes through various osteoporotic bones. The motive behind this research is to classify the different stages of osteoporosis using machine learning. Three supervised classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine for Classification (SVC), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) are applied to classify the different stages and their performance is analyzed. Features are extracted from attenuated signals and used to train the model. The results demonstrate that implementing machine learning to classify stages of osteoporosis is promising.",

        "title": "Disease prognosis using machine learning algorithms based on new clinical dataset",
        "abstract": "Today, artificial intelligence-based solutions are produced to facilitate human life in almost every field. The healthcare sector is one of the sectors which took advantage of these solutions. Due to reasons such as the world’s ever-expanding population, ongoing epidemics, and the emergence of new disease types, it is becoming increasingly difficult for a patient to benefit from health services quickly and to make an accurate diagnosis. At this juncture, artificial intelligence reduces the patient density in hospitals, enables patients to access accurate information, and allows medical students to practice by seeing new cases. In this study, a new and reliable dataset was created with disease information obtained from various sources under the supervision of a specialist medical doctor. Then, new patient histories were added to the dataset used in the previous study, the experiments were repeated with the same algorithms, and the accuracy score comparison was presented. The created dataset includes 2006 unique patient histories, 358 symptoms, and 141 diseases and we think it will be a valuable dataset for researchers who make developments using machine learning in the field of healthcare. Various machine learning algorithms have been used in the training process to predict diseases belonging to different branches of medicine, such as diabetes, bronchial asthma, and covid. Besides, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multilayer Perceptron, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms, we also studied popular boosting algorithms such as XGBoost and LightGBM. All algorithms were validated with cross-validation and performance comparisons were made with different performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. It is also the first study to achieve\nan accuracy score of 99.33% with a dataset that involves a greater number of diseases than the datasets used in the studies examined.",

        "title": "A Data Enhancement Approach to Improve Machine Learning Performance for Predicting Health Status Using Remote Healthcare Data",
        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is becoming tremendously important to improve the performance of remote healthcare systems. Portable health clinic (PHC), a remote healthcare system contains a triage function that classifies the patients in two major groups - (a)healthy and (b)unhealthy. Unhealthy patients require regular health checkups. This paper aims to predict the status of the registered patients to decide the follow-up date and frequency. Health management cost can be reduced by decreasing the number of follow-up frequency. We carried out an experiment on 271 corporate members and monitored their health status in every three months and collected four phases of data. The data records contain clinical data, socio-demographical data, dietary behavior data. However, most of the machine learning algorithms can not directly work with categorical data. Several encoding techniques are available which can also enhance the prediction performance. In this paper, We applied three encoding techniques and proposed a new encoding approach to handle categorical variables. The result shows that Random Forest Classifier performs the best with 95.33% accuracy. A comparison chart displaying the performance of eight different supervised learning algorithms in terms of three existing encoding mechanisms is reported.",

Explainability, or the ability of an ML model to justify its outcomes and assist clinicians in rationalizing the model prediction, has been generally understood to be critical to establishing trust. However, the field suffers from the lack of concrete definitions for usable explanations in different settings. To identify specific aspects of explainability that may catalyze building trust in ML models, we surveyed clinicians from two distinct acute care specialties (Intenstive Care Unit and Emergency Department). We use their feedback to characterize when explainability helps to improve clinicians' trust in ML models. We further identify the classes of explanations that clinicians identified as most relevant and crucial for effective translation to clinical practice. Finally, we discern concrete metrics for rigorous evaluation of clinical explainability methods. By integrating perceptions of explainability between clinicians and ML researchers we hope to facilitate the endorsement and broader adoption and sustained use of ML systems in healthcare.",

        "title": "Cardiac Diagnostic Feature and Demographic Identification Models: A Futuristic Approach for Smart Healthcare Using Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Around the world, every year, about 17 million people death cause happen due to CardioVascular Diseases (CVD). As per clinical records, primarily sufferers exhibit myocardial infarctions and Heart Failures (HF). Creatinine is a Musculo - skeletal waste product. The kidneys filter creatinine from the blood and excrete it through the urine in a healthy body. High creatinine levels can suggest renal problems. Elevated Serum Creatinine (SC) has been well established in the HF. Patients’ electronic medical records can be used to quantify symptoms and other related clinical laboratory test values, which would then be utilized to direct biostatistics exploration to uncover patterns and associations that doctors would otherwise miss. The latest American Heart Association guidelines for 1500 mg/d sodium tend to be sufficiently relevant for patients with stage A and B with HF. In this article, we used a dataset of the year 2015 of heart patients records of 299 patients. The present paper used the data analytic and statistical tools to verify the significant differences between alive and dead patients’ SC and Serum Sodium (SS). It also demonstrates the impact of significant features on abnormal SC and SS on the Survival-Status levels. The Age-Group feature, which is derived from age attribute and, Ejection Fraction (EF), anemia, platelets, Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK), Blood-Pressure (BP), gender, diabetes, and smoking-status were utilized to determine the potential contributing features to mortality with Cox regression model. The Kaplan Meier plot was used to investigate the overall pattern of survival concerning age-group. During pre-processing of the dataset, Age and SS were removed due to multicollinear features during performing machine learning algorithms experiments. This paper also predicted patients’ survival, age group, and gender using supervised machine learning classifiers. Detection of significant features would help in making informed decisions to balance the lifestyle of heart patients. The author revealed that the patient’s follow-up months, as well as SC, EF, CPK, and platelets, are sufficient key features to predict heart patient survival using Random Forest (RF) stratified 10-fold CV method with accuracy (96%) with 5% Standard Deviation (SD) from medical records dataset. We identified the age-group and gender of the patient, and the RF model outperformed others with the best accuracy 96% and 94% in both cases having 11% SD. Also, prominent features such as CPK, SC, follow-up month, platelets, and ejection were found to be significant factors in predicting the patient’s age-group. Smoking habits, CPK, platelets, follow-up month, and SC of each patient were discovered to be significant predictors of patient gender. The hypothetical study proved that SC and SS making substantial differences in the survival of patients (p &lt; 0.05) and failed to reject that anemia, diabetes, and BP making a significant impact on the creatinine and sodium of each patient (p &gt; 0.05). With χ2(1) = 8.565, the Kaplan Meier plot revealed that mortality was high in the extremely elder age-group. The finding has possible effects on clinical practice and becomes a new medical support system when predicting whether a patient can survive a heart attack or not. The doctor should primarily concentrate on follow-up month, SC and EF, CPK, and platelet count since the aim is to understand whether a patient survives after HF.",

        "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) has been a staple method for identifying certain health conditions in patients since its discovery. Due to the many different types of classifiers available to use, the analysis methods are also equally numerous. In this review, we will be examining specifically machine learning methods that have been developed for EEG analysis with bioengineering applications. We reviewed literature from 1988 to 2018 to capture previous and current classification methods for EEG in multiple applications. From this information, we are able to determine the overall effectiveness of each machine learning method as well as the key characteristics. We have found that all the primary methods used in machine learning have been applied in some form in EEG classification. This ranges from Naive-Bayes to Decision Tree/Random Forest, to Support Vector Machine (SVM). Supervised learning methods are on average of higher accuracy than their unsupervised counterparts. This includes SVM and KNN. While each of the methods individually is limited in their accuracy in their respective applications, there is hope that the combination of methods when implemented properly has a higher overall classification accuracy. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Machine Learning applications used in EEG analysis. It also gives an overview of each of the methods and general applications that each is best suited to.",

        "abstract": "While semi-supervised learning (SSL) has received tremendous attentions in many machine learning tasks due to its successful use of unlabeled data, existing SSL algorithms use either all unlabeled examples or the unlabeled examples with a fixed high-confidence prediction during the training progress. However, it is possible that too many correct/wrong pseudo labeled examples are eliminated/selected. In this work we develop a simple yet powerful framework, whose key idea is to select a subset of training examples from the unlabeled data when performing existing SSL methods so that only the unlabeled examples with pseudo labels related to the labeled data will be used to train models. The selection is performed at each updating iteration by only keeping the examples whose losses are smaller than a given threshold that is dynamically adjusted through the iteration. Our proposed approach, Dash, enjoys its adaptivity in terms of unlabeled data selection and its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we theoretically establish the convergence rate of Dash from the view of non-convex optimization. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art over benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Personalized Healthcare (PH) is a new patientoriented healthcare approach which expects to improve the traditional healthcare system. The focus of this new advancement is the patient data collected from patient Electronic health records (EHR), Internet of Things (IoT) sensor devices, wearables and mobile devices, web-based information and social media. PH applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to the collected dataset to improve disease progression technique, disease prediction, patient selfmanagement and clinical intervention. Machine learning techniques are widely used in this regard to develop analytic models. These models are integrated into different healthcare service applications and clinical decision support systems. These models mainly analyse the collected data from sensor devices and other sources to identify behavioral patterns and clinical conditions of the patient. For example, these models analyse the collected data to identify the patient's improvements, habits and anomaly in daily routine, changes in sleeping and mobility, eating, drinking and digestive pattern. Based on those patterns the healthcare applications and the clinical decision support systems recommend lifestyle advice, special treatment and care plans for the patient. The doctors and caregivers can also be engaged in the care plan process to validate lifestyle advice. However, there are many uncertainties and a grey area when it comes to applying machine learning in this context. Clinical, behaviour and lifestyle data in nature are very sensitive. There could be different types of biased involved in the process of data collection and interpretation. The training data model could have an older version of the dataset. All these could lead to an incorrect decision from the system without the user's knowledge. In this paper, some of the standards of the ML models reported in the recent research trends, identify the reliability issues and propose improvements.",

        "abstract": "At present, a multifaceted clinical disease known as heart failure disease can affect a greater number of people in the world. In the early stages, to evaluate and diagnose the disease of heart failure, cardiac centers and hospitals are heavily based on ECG. The ECG can be considered as a regular tool. Heart disease early detection is a critical concern in healthcare services (HCS). This paper presents the different machine learning technologies based on heart disease detection brief analysis. Firstly, Naïve Bayes with a weighted approach is used for predicting heart disease. The second one, according to the features of frequency domain, time domain, and information theory, is automatic and analyze ischemic heart disease localization/detection. Two classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) with XGBoost with the best performance are selected for the classification in this method. The third one is the heart failure automatic identification method by using an improved SVM based on the duality optimization scheme also analyzed. Finally, for a clinical decision support system (CDSS), an effective heart disease prediction model (HDPM) is used, which includes density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) for outlier detection and elimination, a hybrid synthetic minority over-sampling technique-edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) for balancing the training data distribution, and XGBoost for heart disease prediction. Machine learning can be applied in the medical industry for disease diagnosis, detection, and prediction. The major purpose of this paper is to give clinicians a tool to help them diagnose heart problems early on. As a result, it will be easier to treat patients effectively and avoid serious repercussions. This study uses XGBoost to test alternative decision tree classification algorithms in the hopes of improving the accuracy of heart disease diagnosis. In terms of precision, accuracy, f1-measure, and recall as performance parameters above mentioned, four types of machine learning (ML) models are compared.",

        "abstract": "Continuous monitoring of diabetic patients improves their quality of life. The use of multiple technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded systems, communication technologies, artificial intelligence, and smart devices can reduce the economic costs of the healthcare system. Different communication technologies have made it possible to provide personalized and remote health services. In order to respond to the needs of future intelligent e-health applications, we are called to develop intelligent healthcare systems and expand the number of applications connected to the network. Therefore, the 5G network should support intelligent healthcare applications, to meet some important requirements such as high bandwidth and high energy efficiency. This article presents an intelligent architecture for monitoring diabetic patients by using machine learning algorithms. The architecture elements included smart devices, sensors, and smartphones to collect measurements from the body. The intelligent system collected the data received from the patient, and performed data classification using machine learning in order to make a diagnosis. The proposed prediction system was evaluated by several machine learning algorithms, and the simulation results demonstrated that the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm gives superior classification accuracy, sensitivity, and precision compared to other algorithms.",

        "abstract": "In pervasive healthcare monitoring, activity recognition is critical information for adequate management of the patient. Despite the great number of studies on this topic, a contextually relevant parameter that has received less attention is intensity recognition. In the present study, we investigated the potential advantage of coupling activity and intensity, namely, Activity-Intensity, in accelerometer data to improve the description of daily activities of individuals. We further tested two alternatives for supervised classification. In the first alternative, the activity and intensity are inferred together by applying a single classifier algorithm. In the other alternative, the activity and intensity are classified separately. In both cases, the algorithms used for classification are k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The results showed the viability of the classification with good accuracy for Activity-Intensity recognition. The best approach was KNN implemented in the single classifier alternative, which resulted in 79% of accuracy. Using two classifiers, the result was 97% accuracy for activity recognition (Random Forest), and 80% for intensity recognition (KNN), which resulted in 78% for activity-intensity coupled. These findings have potential applications to improve the contextualized evaluation of movement by health professionals in the form of a decision system with expert rules.",

        "title": "Analysis of Machine Learning Methods for COVID-19 Detection Using Serum Raman Spectroscopy",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT One of the most challenging aspects of the emergent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been the need for massive diagnostic tests to detect and track infection rates at the population level. Current tests such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction can be low-throughput and labor intensive. An ultra-fast and accurate mode of detecting COVID-19 infection is crucial for healthcare workers to make informed decisions in fast-paced clinical settings. The high-dimensional, feature-rich components of Raman spectra and validated predictive power for identifying human disease, cancer, as well as bacterial and viral infections pose the potential to train a supervised classification machine learning algorithm on Raman spectra of patient serum samples to detect COVID-19 infection. We developed a novel stacked subsemble classifier model coupled with an iteratively validated and automated feature selection and engineering workflow to predict COVID-19 infection status from Raman spectra of 250 human serum samples, with a 10-fold cross-validated classification accuracy of 98.0% (98.6% precision and 98.5% recall). Furthermore, we benchmarked nine machine learning and artificial neural network models when evaluated using eight standalone performance metrics to assess whether ensemble methods offered any improvement from baseline machine learning models. Using a rank-normalized scores derived from the performance metrics, the stacked subsemble model ranked higher than the Multi-layer Perceptron, which in turn ranked higher than the eight other machine learning models. This study serves as a proof of concept that stacked ensemble machine learning models are a powerful predictive tool for COVID-19 diagnostics.",

Statistical models are availabel for prediction of diabetes but these provide poor performance. This article proposed machine learning based model for prediction of diabetes disease. Three supervised machine learning algorithms namely K-NN, Linear SVM and Random Forest have been chosen for diabetes prediction for early diagnosis. The area under the curve and accuracy of each of these models have been obtained using PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset from UCI repository. The comparative results demonstrate that among these three algorithms random forest is the best model in terms of accuracy of 78.57 and AUC of 95.08 for diabetes risk prediction. The contribution of this article will help the healthcare professionals for the early prediction of the disease and taking appropriate treatment. The proposed approach can be applied for detection of other diseases.",

        "title": "Developing a Predictive Health Care System for Diabetes Diagnosis as a Machine Learning-Based Web Service",
        "abstract": "Background: \nDiabetes is one of the dangerous and silent illnesses that cause sudden death. It can occur at any time and may cause great injury to the organs of the body or damage them completely. So, we must investigate this disease at the beginning of its appearance and before it gets hard to treat. With the fast advancement of Machine Learning (ML), these approaches enhanced the efficiency of decision processes in a wide range of applications, including medical diagnostics. \nMaterials and Methods: \nIn this paper, we chose a medical application field and used supervised machine learning algorithms to construct a high-accuracy prediction model for diabetes in humans at an early stage, before it progresses to the point of morbidity or fatality. The suggested model can extract hidden knowledge from diabetes-related data gathered from the Kaggle machine learning repository. We utilize Microsoft Azure ML Studio to model these ML algorithms. \nResults: \nThis study will benefit the health industry by offering users an online tool (i.e., web service) that allows them to input data and receive results that predict whether or not the person has diabetes. As a result, prior knowledge and ongoing monitoring of their diabetic health state will lower the risk of complications, morbidity, and death caused by this illness. After running numerous experiments with the classifier models to evaluate the proposed system, several performance indicators, including Recall, Precision, Accuracy, and f1-score, are measured for comparison. Based on the classification output, it was determined that Decision Forest is a better strategy and produces better results than the other ML approaches. \nConclusion: \nThe suggested system's key contribution is to improve healthcare quality, minimize hospitalizations, and lower the high expenditures of healthcare and drugs. ",

        "abstract": "While humans as a whole do live longer nowadays than ever before, we now suffer certain illnesses to a degree never seen in the past - including rising rates of Diabetes, Hypertension, Hypotension, Cholesterol imbalance, obesity and, ailments such as fever. People around the world are preemptively seeking medical advices on how to live a healthy lifestyle. They are looking to lower their risk of various diseases. A healthcare chatbot can play a significant role to monitor a person’s health status. A healthcare chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users as a virtual medical assistant. Our study shows, there are some healthcare chatbots available in English and other languages but not in Bangla. In this paper, we have demonstrated a machine learning-based closed domain Bangla healthcare chatbot ‘Disha (Direction)’ which can converse in Bangla with the user with the help of its knowledge base and through learning from interactions with the user. It helps a user to diagnose potential diseases based on inputted symptoms, keep track of a user’s health status, and alert a user from potential health hazards. This paper explores the use of six supervised machine learning approaches and showed significant efficiency.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that has caused a worldwide pandemic and put a strain on the global healthcare systems. To better protect and treat higher risk individuals and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems, it is crucial to identify risk factors and build accurate predictive models for COVID-19 related health outcomes. However, current predictive models focus on predicting the risk of mortality, and rely on COVID-19 specific medical data such as CT scans and COVID-19 lab tests results after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. To address these issues, we developed an innovative supervised machine learning framework using synthetic veteran Electronic Health Records (EHR) which were routinely collected during past clinic visits. Our models accurately predicted COVID-19 related health outcomes including mortality, ventilation, days in hospital or ICU. In particular, we developed a series of unique and effective data processing algorithms, including data cleaning, vector representation, initial feature screening. Then we trained models using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies combined with different parameter settings. Our machine learning pipeline not only consistently outperformed those developed by other research groups using the same set of EHR, but also achieved similar accuracy as those trained on medical data that were only available after COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, top risk factors for COVID-19 were identified, which include age, diabetes, metabolic syndromes, heart disease, kidney disease etc., and are consistent with epidemiology findings. Built on veteran’s EHR, our results were especially relevant to veterans and filled in the gap of missing COVID-19 research for veterans who are at much higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness than the general population. This project also demonstrated that longitudinal EHR data can be successfully leveraged to provide a holistic prediction of an individual’s health risk based on past health records, which is critical for controlling emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Accelerometers are increasingly utilized in healthcare research to assess human activity. Accelerometry data are often collected by mailing accelerometers to participants, who wear the accelerometers to collect data on their activity. The devices are then mailed back to the laboratory for analysis. We develop models to classify days in accelerometry data as activity from actual human wear or the delivery process. These models can be used to automate the cleaning of accelerometry datasets that are adulterated with activity from delivery. Methods For the classification of delivery days in accelerometry data, we developed statistical and machine learning models in a supervised learning context using a large human activity and delivery labeled accelerometry dataset. We extracted several features, which were included to develop random forest, logistic regression, mixed effects regression, and multilayer perceptron models, while convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, and hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network models were developed without feature extraction. Model performances were assessed using Monte Carlo cross-validation. Results We found that a hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network performed best in the classification task with an F1 score of 0.960 but simpler models such as logistic regression and random forest also had excellent performance with F1 scores of 0.951 and 0.957, respectively. Conclusion The models developed in this study can be used to classify days in accelerometry data as either human or delivery activity. An analyst can weigh the larger computational cost and greater performance of the convolutional recurrent neural network against the faster but slightly less powerful random forest or logistic regression. The best performing models for classification of delivery data are publicly available on the open source R package, PhysicalActivity.",

        "title": "An Evaluation of Machine Learning Classifiers for Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment and Normal Cognition",
        "abstract": "Dementia has a negative impact on global healthcare that has become a serious concern worldwide. The most common cause, Alzheimer's disease, underlies the majority of dementia. The identification and accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease in its initial stage is most critical, of which has several important practical applications. However, a reliable diagnosis remains a challenging task and requires a combination of methods based on important clinical information. Developing computer-aided diagnosis systems to support early Alzheimer's disease detection is essential for effective treatment planning. In this study, a nationwide cohort dataset, the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease is classified by using eight state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms namely Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Bagging and AdaBoost. The best performing model appeared to be the XGBoost classifier yielding an accuracy of 82.09%. Thus, the present research shows that the application of the machine learning model to the KBASE dataset will offer an efficient clinical classification of cognitively normal control individuals, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients and provides a framework for clinical decision systems.",

        "title": "Does COVID-19 Clinical Status Associate with Outcome Severity? An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach for Knowledge Extraction",
        "abstract": "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 195 million people have been infected and 4.2 million have died from the disease or its side effects. Physicians, healthcare scientists and medical staff continuously try to deal with overloaded hospital admissions, while in parallel, they try to identify meaningful correlations between the severity of infected patients with their symptoms, comorbidities and biomarkers. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been used recently in many areas related to COVID-19 healthcare. The main goal is to manage effectively the wide variety of issues related to COVID-19 and its consequences. The existing applications of ML to COVID-19 healthcare are based on supervised classifications which require a labeled training dataset, serving as reference point for learning, as well as predefined classes. However, the existing knowledge about COVID-19 and its consequences is still not solid and the points of common agreement among different scientific communities are still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to follow an unsupervised clustering approach, where prior knowledge is not required (tabula rasa). More specifically, 268 hospitalized patients at the First Propaedeutic Department of Internal Medicine of AHEPA University Hospital of Thessaloniki were assessed in terms of 40 clinical variables (numerical and categorical), leading to a high-dimensionality dataset. Dimensionality reduction was performed by applying a principal component analysis (PCA) on the numerical part of the dataset and a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) on the categorical part of the dataset. Then, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was applied to Gaussian mixture models (GMM) in order to identify the optimal number of clusters under which the best grouping of patients occurs. The proposed methodology identified four clusters of patients with similar clinical characteristics. The analysis revealed a cluster of asymptomatic patients that resulted in death at a rate of 23.8%. This striking result forces us to reconsider the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 clinical symptoms and the patient’s mortality.",

        "abstract": "\nMachine learning along with artificial intelligence (AI) seem to make a paradigm shift into the healthcare domain by ensuring better diagnosis and treatment approaches. Considering the Mexico’s increasing prevalence of dia- betes, timely diagnosis and properly determined interven- tion approach becomes essential. This project presents a unique AI-based web application that simulates and eval- uates diabetes risk in individuals with the help of machine learning and generative AI, enabling personalized health recommendations. Specifically, the application evaluates eight parameters such as glucose, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc. All of the parameters will allow users to foresee the risk of diabetes and determine the appropriate response to it. Moreover, the application uses Google Gemini, a generative AI model, to provide customized diabetes interventions by analyzing a patient’s health data, and determines likely future health scenarios. Such interven- tions relate and explain the causes of diabetes, abnormal characteristics of human health, and effective dietary and lifestyle changes. The system is built using Streamlit which allows for a graphic interface that is convenient whereby the users input health data and instantly get diagnosis and interventions. It can be inferred that there is a huge opportunity in the realm of health technology advancing in terms of better preventive healthcare, which results in better patient outcomes as well as better integration of machine learning and AI.\nKeywords—Diabetes prediction, machine learning, generative AI, healthcare analytics, Streamlit, supervised learning.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurological condition that affects social interaction, communication, and behavioral patterns. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical to improving the quality of life for individuals with autism. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on time-consuming behavioral assessments conducted by specialists, which can delay detection and intervention. This study proposes a machine learning- based approach to predict autism by analyzing behavioral, demographic, and clinical data. By leveraging algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, the system identifies patterns and correlations in data that are indicative of autism traits. Features such as social interaction behaviors, communication responses, and demographic factors are used to train and validate the predictive model. The proposed system aims to provide a faster, cost-effective, and scalable solution for autism screening, enabling early detection and reducing the burden on healthcare professionals. This machine learning framework not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also facilitates personalized interventions, contributing to better outcomes for individuals and their families.\n\nKeywords: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Machine Learning, Jupyter Notebook, Python, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Voting Classifier, Early Diagnosis, Predictive Modeling, Feature Selection, Data Classification, Autism Screening, Healthcare AI, Behavioral Data Analysis, Clinical Data Processing, Supervised Learning, Ensemble Learning.",

        "title": "A survey on semi-supervised learning",
        "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning is the branch of machine learning concerned with using labelled as well as unlabelled data to perform certain learning tasks. Conceptually situated between supervised and unsupervised learning, it permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabelled data available in many use cases in combination with typically smaller sets of labelled data. In recent years, research in this area has followed the general trends observed in machine learning, with much attention directed at neural network-based models and generative learning. The literature on the topic has also expanded in volume and scope, now encompassing a broad spectrum of theory, algorithms and applications. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and engineers alike to utilize it. Filling this void, we present an up-to-date overview of semi-supervised learning methods, covering earlier work as well as more recent advances. We focus primarily on semi-supervised classification, where the large majority of semi-supervised learning research takes place. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the field as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches and algorithms developed over the past two decades, with an emphasis on the most prominent and currently relevant work. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy of semi-supervised classification algorithms, which sheds light on the different conceptual and methodological approaches for incorporating unlabelled data into the training process. Lastly, we show how the fundamental assumptions underlying most semi-supervised learning algorithms are closely connected to each other, and how they relate to the well-known semi-supervised clustering assumption.",

        "title": "Exploring the growth of COVID‐19 cases using exponential modelling across 42 countries and predicting signs of early containment using machine learning",
        "abstract": "Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic spread by the single‐stranded RNA severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) belongs to the seventh generation of the coronavirus family. Following an unusual replication mechanism, its extreme ease of transmissivity has put many countries under lockdown. With the uncertainty of developing a cure/vaccine for the infection in the near future, the onus currently lies on healthcare infrastructure, policies, government activities, and behaviour of the people to contain the virus. This research uses exponential growth modelling studies to understand the spreading patterns of SARS‐CoV‐2 and identifies countries that showed early signs of containment until March 26, 2020. Predictive supervised machine learning models are built using infrastructure, environment, policies, and infection‐related independent variables to predict early containment. COVID‐19 infection data across 42 countries are used. Logistic regression results show a positive significant relationship between healthcare infrastructure and lockdown policies, and signs of early containment. Machine learning models based on logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machines are developed and show accuracies between 76.2% and 92.9% to predict early signs of infection containment. Other policies and the decisions taken by countries to contain the infection are also discussed.",

        "title": "A machine learning-based on-demand sweat glucose reporting platform",
        "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic endocrine disease that occurs due to an imbalance in glucose levels and altering carbohydrate metabolism. It is a leading cause of morbidity, resulting in a reduced quality of life even in developed societies, primarily affected by a sedentary lifestyle and often leading to mortality. Keeping track of blood glucose levels noninvasively has been made possible due to diverse breakthroughs in wearable sensor technology coupled with holistic digital healthcare. Efficient glucose management has been revolutionized by the development of continuous glucose monitoring sensors and wearable, non/minimally invasive devices that measure glucose concentration by exploiting different physical principles, e.g., glucose oxidase, fluorescence, or skin dielectric properties, and provide real-time measurements every 1–5 min. This paper presents a highly novel and completely non-invasive sweat sensor platform technology that can measure and report glucose concentrations from passively expressed human eccrine sweat using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and affinity capture probe functionalized sensor surfaces. The sensor samples 1–5 µL of sweat from the wearer every 1–5 min and reports sweat glucose from a machine learning algorithm that samples the analytical reference values from the electrochemical sweat sensor. These values are then converted to continuous time-varying signals using the interpolation methodology. Supervised machine learning, the decision tree regression algorithm, shows the goodness of fit R2 of 0.94 was achieved with an RMSE value of 0.1 mg/dL. The output of the model was tested on three human subject datasets. The results were able to capture the glucose progression trend correctly. Sweet sensor platform technology demonstrates a dynamic response over the physiological sweat glucose range of 1–4 mg/dL measured from 3 human subjects. The technology described in the manuscript shows promise for real-time biomarkers such as glucose reporting from passively expressed human eccrine sweat.",

With the increase in emerging technologies such as data mining tools, along with machine learning algorithms, new prospects in the medical field for automatic diagnosis have been developed, with which the prediction of a disease at an early stage is possible. Early detection of the disease may increase the survival rate of patients. The main purpose of the study was to predict breast cancer disease as benign or malignant by using supervised machine learning algorithms such as the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF) and to compare their performance in terms of the accuracy, precision, F1 score, support, and AUC. The experimental results demonstrated that the MLP achieved a high prediction accuracy of 99.4%, followed by random forest (96.4%) and K-NN (76.3%). The diagnosis rates of the MLP, random forest and K-NN were 99.9%, 99.6%, and 73%, respectively. The study provides a clear idea of the accomplishments of classification algorithms in terms of their prediction ability, which can aid healthcare professionals in diagnosing chronic breast cancer efficiently.",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) has demonstrated efficacy in computer imaging and other self-contained digital workflows, but has failed to substantially impact routine clinical care. This is no longer because of poor adoption of Electronic Health Records Systems (EHRS), but because ML4H needs an infrastructure for development, deployment and evaluation within the healthcare institution. In this paper, we propose a design pattern called a Clinical Deployment Environment (CDE). We sketch the five pillars of the CDE: (1) real world development supported by live data where ML4H teams can iteratively build and test at the bedside (2) an ML-Ops platform that brings the rigour and standards of continuous deployment to ML4H (3) design and supervision by those with expertise in AI safety (4) the methods of implementation science that enable the algorithmic insights to influence the behaviour of clinicians and patients and (5) continuous evaluation that uses randomisation to avoid bias but in an agile manner. The CDE is intended to answer the same requirements that bio-medicine articulated in establishing the translational medicine domain. It envisions a transition from “real-world” data to “real-world” development.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nManagement of patients in the acute care setting requires accurate diagnosis and rapid initiation of validated treatments; therefore, this setting is likely to be an environment in which cognitive augmentation of the clinician's provision of care with technology rooted in artificial intelligence, such as machine learning (ML), is likely to eventuate.\n\n\nSOURCES OF DATA\nPubMed and Google Scholar with search terms that included ML, intensive/critical care unit, electronic health records (EHR), anesthesia information management systems and clinical decision support were the primary sources for this report.\n\n\nAREAS OF AGREEMENT\nDifferent categories of learning of large clinical datasets, often contained in EHRs, are used for training in ML. Supervised learning uses algorithm-based models, including support vector machines, to pair patients' attributes with an expected outcome. Unsupervised learning uses clustering algorithms to define to which disease grouping a patient's attributes most closely approximates. Reinforcement learning algorithms use ongoing environmental feedback to deterministically pursue likely patient outcome.\n\n\nAREAS OF CONTROVERSY\nApplication of ML can result in undesirable outcomes over concerns related to fairness, transparency, privacy and accountability. Whether these ML technologies irrevocably change the healthcare workforce remains unresolved.\n\n\nGROWING POINTS\nWell-resourced Learning Health Systems are likely to exploit ML technology to gain the fullest benefits for their patients. How these clinical advantages can be extended to patients in health systems that are neither well-endowed, nor have the necessary data gathering technologies, needs to be urgently addressed to avoid further disparities in healthcare.",

        "title": "Towards the Application of Machine Learning in Emergency Informatics",
        "abstract": "Emergency care is one of the cornerstone parts of the world health organization's action plan. Rapid response and immediate care are considered in agile emergency care. Artificial intelligence (AI) and informatics have been applied to fulfill these requirements through automated emergency technology. Machine learning (ML) is one of the main parts of some of these proposed technologies. There are various ML algorithms and techniques which are potentially applicable for different purposes of emergency care. AI-based approaches using classification and clustering algorithms, natural language processing, and text mining are some of the possible techniques that could prove useful for investigating models of emergency prevention and management and proposing improved procedures for handling such critical situations. ML is known as a field of AI which attempts to automatically learn from data and applies that learning to make better decisions. Decision-support tools can apply the results of either supervised or various semi-supervised or unsupervised learning methods to tackle the how decisions about emergency situations are typically handled by the best professionals at the scene of an emergency, in the pre-hospital, and in healthcare facility settings. Enhanced and rapid communication at the moment of emergency, with the most effective decision making for triaging to estimate the acute nature of injuries and possible complications, how to keep a patient stable on the way to the care facility, and also avoiding adverse drug reactions, are some of the possible directions for exploring how ML can help to gather the data and to make emergency management more efficient and effective. The wide range of scenarios present in emergency situations and the complexity of different legal and ethical constraints on what responding personnel are allowed to perform on an injured subject before reaching a hospital makes for a most challenging set of problems for investigating the components of \"intelligent\" decision support that could help in these highly interactive and humanly tragic situations.",

        "abstract": "Given the aging population, healthcare systems need to be established to deal with health issues such as injurious falls. Wearable devices can be used to detect falls. However, most wearable devices are obtrusive, and patients generally do not like or may forget to wear them. In this study, we developed an unobtrusive monitoring system using infrared technology to unobtrusively detect locations and recognize human activities such as sitting, standing, walking, lying, and falling. We prototyped a system consisting of two 24×32 thermal array sensors and collected data from healthy young volunteers performing ten different scenarios. A supervised deep learning (DL)-based approach classified activities and detected locations from images. The performance of the DL approach was also compared with the machine learning (ML)-based methods. In addition, we fused the data of two sensors and formed a stereo system, which resulted in better performance compared to a single sensor. Furthermore, to detect critical activities such as falling and lying on floor, we performed a binary classification in which one class was falling plus lying on floor and another class was all the remaining activities. Using the DL-based algorithm on the stereo dataset to recognize activities, overall average accuracy and F1-score were achieved as 97.6%, and 0.935, respectively. These scores for location detection were 97.3%, and 0.927, respectively. These scores for binary classification were 97.9%, and 0.945, respectively. Our results suggest the proposed system recognized human activities, detected locations, and detected critical activities namely falling and lying on floor accurately.",

The infection is transferred through blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes, fleas ticks etc. Every year from diseases such as yellow fever, Malaria more than 700,000 deaths occur. These diseases are most common in tropical and subtropical areas and affect the underprivileged populations. Deep learning an essential part of Artificial Intelligence provides an uncanny power to systems to construct a complex network using layers of perceptrons which mimic the human neurons. This network Combined with algorithms of Machine Learning may serve as one of the most powerful tool in healthcare to classify and analyze huge amount of medical data and predict future trends through Supervised Learning. The paper we focused on effective prediction of the vector borne disease outbreak (Multiclass Classification) of three diseases (Chikungunya, Malaria, Dengue) across the Indian-subcontinent. We have examined and refined our model over data collected across India in 2013-2017. We have put forward a Convolutional Neural Network outbreak risk prediction algorithm using contrasting data. To our finest understanding, none of the previous works have centered on contrasting data in area of analysis of medical data. The prediction accuracy of our suggested CNN algorithm is 88%.",

        "abstract": "Access to healthcare, including physiotherapy, is increasingly occurring through virtual formats. At-home adherence to physical therapy programs is often poor and few tools exist to objectively measure participation. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the potential for performing automatic, unsupervised video-based monitoring of at-home low-back and shoulder physiotherapy exercises using a mobile phone camera. Joint locations were extracted from the videos of healthy subjects performing low-back and shoulder physiotherapy exercises using an open source pose detection framework. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify physiotherapy exercises based on the segments of keypoint time series data. The model’s performance as a function of input keypoint combinations was studied in addition to its robustness to variation in the camera angle. The CNN model achieved optimal performance using a total of 12 pose estimation landmarks from the upper and lower body (low-back exercise classification: 0.995 ± 0.009; shoulder exercise classification: 0.963 ± 0.020). Training the CNN on a variety of angles was found to be effective in making the model robust to variations in video filming angle. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a smartphone camera and a supervised machine learning model to effectively classify at-home physiotherapy participation and could provide a low-cost, scalable method for tracking adherence to physical therapy exercise programs in a variety of settings.",

        "title": "Predicting Postoperative Length of Stay for Isolated Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patients Using Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Purpose Predictive analytics (PA) is a new trending approach in the field of healthcare that uses machine learning to build a prediction model using supervised learning algorithms. Isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (iCABG), an open-heart surgery, is commonly performed in the treatment of coronary heart disease. Aim The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a model to predict postoperative length of stay (PLoS) for iCABG patients using supervised machine learning techniques, and to identify the features with the highest contribution to the model. Methods This is a retrospective study that uses historic data of adult patients who underwent isolated CABG (iCABG). After initial data pre-processing, data imputation using the kNN method was applied. The study used five prediction models using Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and k Nearest Neighbor algorithms. Data imbalance was managed using the following widely used methods: oversampling, undersampling, “Both”, and random over-sampling examples (ROSE). The features selection process was conducted using the Boruta method. Two techniques were applied to examine the performance of the models, (70%, 30%) split and cross-validation, respectively. Models were evaluated by comparing their performance using AUC and other metrics. Results In the final dataset, six distinct features and 621 instances were used to develop the models. A total of 20 models were developed using R statistical software. The model generated using Random Forest with “Both” resampling method and cross-validation technique was deemed the best fit (AUC=0.81; F1 score=0.82; and recall=0.82). Attributes found to be highly predictive of PLoS were pulmonary artery systolic, age, height, EuroScore II, intra-aortic balloon pump used, and complications during operation. Conclusion This study demonstrates the significance and effectiveness of building a model that predicts PLoS for iCABG patients using patient specifications and pre-/intra-operative measures.",

        "title": "Prototype Learning for Medical Time Series Classification via Human–Machine Collaboration",
        "abstract": "Deep neural networks must address the dual challenge of delivering high-accuracy predictions and providing user-friendly explanations. While deep models are widely used in the field of time series modeling, deciphering the core principles that govern the models’ outputs remains a significant challenge. This is crucial for fostering the development of trusted models and facilitating domain expert validation, thereby empowering users and domain experts to utilize them confidently in high-risk decision-making contexts (e.g., decision-support systems in healthcare). In this work, we put forward a deep prototype learning model that supports interpretable and manipulable modeling and classification of medical time series (i.e., ECG signal). Specifically, we first optimize the representation of single heartbeat data by employing a bidirectional long short-term memory and attention mechanism, and then construct prototypes during the training phase. The final classification outcomes (i.e., normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and other rhythm) are determined by comparing the input with the obtained prototypes. Moreover, the proposed model presents a human–machine collaboration mechanism, allowing domain experts to refine the prototypes by integrating their expertise to further enhance the model’s performance (contrary to the human-in-the-loop paradigm, where humans primarily act as supervisors or correctors, intervening when required, our approach focuses on a human–machine collaboration, wherein both parties engage as partners, enabling more fluid and integrated interactions). The experimental outcomes presented herein delineate that, within the realm of binary classification tasks—specifically distinguishing between normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation—our proposed model, albeit registering marginally lower performance in comparison to certain established baseline models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory with attention mechanisms (Bi-LSTMAttns), evidently surpasses other contemporary state-of-the-art prototype baseline models. Moreover, it demonstrates significantly enhanced performance relative to these prototype baseline models in the context of triple classification tasks, which encompass normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and other rhythm classifications. The proposed model manifests a commendable prediction accuracy of 0.8414, coupled with macro precision, recall, and F1-score metrics of 0.8449, 0.8224, and 0.8235, respectively, achieving both high classification accuracy as well as good interpretability.",

        "title": "Stack Ensemble Oriented Parkinson Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Approaches Utilizing GridSearchCV-Based Hyper Parameter Tuning.",
        "abstract": "Since the coronavirus came into existence and brought the entire world to a standstill, there have been drastic changes in people's lives that continue to affect them even as the pandemic recedes. The isolation reduced physical activity and hindered access to non-COVID related healthcare during lockdown and the ensuing months brought increased attention to mental health and the neurological disorders that might have been exacerbated. One nervous system disorder that affects the elderly and needs better awareness is Parkinson's disease. We have machine learning and a growing number of deep learning models to predict, and detect its onset; their scope is not completely exhaustive and can still be optimized. In this research, the authors highlight techniques that have been implemented in recent years for prediction of the disease. Models based on the less redundantly used classifiers-naive Bayes, logistic regression, linear-support vector machine, kernelizing support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron-are initially implemented and compared. Based on limitations of the results, an ensemble stack model of hyper-tuned versions using GridSearchCV out of the top performing supervised classifiers along-with extreme gradient boosting classifier is implemented to further improve overall results. In addition, a convolutional neural network-based model is also implemented, and the results are analyzed using two epoch values to compare the performance of deep learning models. The benchmark datasets-UCI Parkinson's data and the spiral and wave datasets-have been used for machine and deep learning respectively. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, support, and F1 score are utilized, and confusion matrices and graphs are plotted for visualization. 94.87% accuracy was achieved using the stacking approach.",

        "abstract": "As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the major cause of death for both sexes and members of most racial and ethnic groups. Cardiovascular disease claims one life in the United States every 34 seconds. The expense of medical services, medications, and lost productivity because of deaths from heart disease causes the United States to lose a significant amount of money each year. At least half of all Americans have one or more of the following three major risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other significant indicators are the presence of diabetes, obesity (high body mass index), a lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption. In recent times, the healthcare sector has discovered that machine learning is a practical and reliable decision-making tool. The latter tends to assist doctors in making informed decisions about the heart condition of a patient. It has become increasingly important to develop an effective early-stage cardiac disease prognosis using digital patient information to enhance clinical decision-making. This study intends to find the most accurate machine learning classifiers for these prognostic uses. To predict cardiac disease, several supervised machine-learning algorithms were used and compared in terms of accuracy and performance. The following methods were used in our research: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K Nearest Neighbor. The heart disease dataset from Kaggle has been used to validate this research. The latter was created using data from the 2020 United States national health status survey of more than 410,000 people, performed yearly by the centers for disease control and prevention.",

        "title": "Comparative Machine Learning Approach in Dementia Patient Classification using Principal Component Analysis",
        "abstract": ": Dementia is one of the brain diseases that were significantly affecting the global population. Mainly it is exposed to older people with an association of memory loss and thinking ability. Unfortunately, there are no proper medications for dementia prevention. Doctors are suggesting that early prediction of this disease can somehow help the patient by slowdown the dementia progress. Nowadays, many computer scientists were using machine learning (ML) algorithms and data-mining operations in the healthcare environment for predicting and diagnosing diseases. The current study designed to develop an ML model for better classification of patients associated with dementia. For that, we developed a feature extraction method with the involvement of three supervised ML techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and logistic regression (LR). Principal component analysis (PCA) was selected to extract relevant features related to the targeted outcome. Performance measures were assessed with accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC values. The accuracy of SVM, LR, and KNN was found as 0.967, 0.983, and 0.976, respectively. The AUC of LR (0.997) and KNN (0.966) were recorded the highest values. With the highest AUC values, KNN and LR were considered optimal classifiers in dementia prediction.",

        "abstract": "Life Expectancy is an important metric to assess the health of a nation. This paper presents a comparative analysis of life expectancy between developed and developing countries with the help of a Supervised Machine Learning model. The prediction model is trained using three regression models, namely Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor. The selection of model is done on the basis of R2 score, Mean Squared Error & Mean Absolute Error. Random Forest Regressor is selected for the development of the prediction model for life expectancy, as it had R2 score as 0.99 and 0.95 on training & testing data respectively, along with 4.43 and 1.58 as the Mean Squared Error & Mean Absolute Error. The comparative analysis is done on the basis of HIV/AIDS, Adult Mortality and Expenditure on Healthcare, as they are the important features suggested by the model. The study undertaken suggests that, developed countries have high life expectancy as compared to developing countries. India has high adult mortality as compared to considered developed countries because of the low expenditure on healthcare. The insights from this analysis can be used by Government and Healthcare sectors for the betterment of society.",

However, real-time models specifically identifying readmissions related to hospital adverse-events are still to be elaborated. A supervised learning approach was adopted using different machine learning algorithms based on features available directly from the hospital information system and on a validated dataset elaborated by a multidisciplinary expert consensus panel. Accuracy results upon testing were in line with comparable studies, and variable across algorithms, with the highest prediction given by Artificial Neuron Networks. Features importances relative to the prediction were identified, in order to provide better representation and interpretation of results. Such a model can pave the way to predictive models for readmissions related to patient harm, the establishment of a learning platform for clinical quality measurement and improvement, and in some cases for an improved clinical management of readmitted patients.",

        "abstract": "This day and age individuals are increasingly giving precedence to their material needs as opposed to self-care, leading to physical and mental strain. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) present a significant menace worldwide, causing about 17.9 million deaths annually which is roughly 32% of global mortality. Heart failure, which impacts over 550,000 individuals on a yearly basis, emerges as an urgent global health concern. The formulation of effective prediction techniques for heart failure proves to be imperative in lessening its repercussions. Linear and machine learning models are put into service to forecast heart failure utilizing a myriad of inputs, comprising clinical data. With the burgeoning population, the early detection and intervention for heart disease grow more complex. Heart disease prevalence has escalated to concerning levels, culminating in untimely deaths due to arterial plaque accumulation. The premature pinpointing of heart disease holds the potential to rescue many lives by upholding arterial wellness. Our research integrates supervised machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease presence, underscoring methods to enhance classifier efficacy. Null values within the dataset are managed through mean value imputation, whereas irrelevant attributes are expunged utilizing information-gain feature selection. By wielding breakthroughs in machine learning (ML), the key aim of this study is to design prognostic models for cardiovascular disease utilizing 12 clinical attributes. By capitalizing on a dataset offered by Davide Chicco and Giuseppe Jurman, encompassing 12 clinical features and 299 data points, the efficacy of three ML algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression is evaluated. Our examination discloses that Logistic Regression showcases the most outstanding accuracy and likelihood in foretelling cardio vascular disease presence. This predictive model exhibits potential in aiding healthcare experts in curtailing heart disease-linked fatalities.",

        "abstract": "- Machine learning has become popular today as so many of its algorithms are now commonly used in different data science projects in various industries especially in the health care sector. It is imperative for researchers and medical professionals to be assisted by machine learning methods in early detection of diseases such as heart disease which is one major killer of humans in our world today. Machine learning algorithms are excellent at learning from data, and since healthcare providers generate huge amount of data on a daily basis, these algorithms can thrive in this field. In this research study, a comparative analytical approach was taken in the determination of which algorithm performs better under the given condition. Various experiments were carried out using cross validation of 5 and 10 folds, to ensure that models created can generalize well enough. This study makes use of data from University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning database containing 303 instances with 14 attributes. The collected data is scaled using Min-Max normalization technique. Different popular models are built using supervised machine learning classification algorithms on the scaled data such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting ensemble method. These algorithms are also evaluated using standard performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. From the experiments carried out, it can be concluded that SVM performs better as it out performs the other algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) concept as a new direction of technological development raises new problems such as valid and timely identification of such devices, security vulnerabilities that can be exploited for malicious activities, and management of such devices. The communication of IoT devices generates traffic that has specific features and differences with respect to conventional devices. This research seeks to analyze the possibilities of applying such features for classifying devices, regardless of their functionality or purpose. This kind of classification is necessary for a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, such as a smart home where the number and types of devices grow daily. This research uses a total of 41 IoT devices. The logistic regression method enhanced by the concept of supervised machine learning (logitboost) was used for developing a classification model. Multiclass classification model was developed using 13 network traffic features generated by IoT devices. Research has shown that it is possible to classify devices into four previously defined classes with high performances and accuracy (99.79%) based on the traffic flow features of such devices. Model performance measures such as precision, F-measure, True Positive Ratio, False Positive Ratio and Kappa coefficient all show high results (0.997–0.999, 0.997–0.999, 0.997–0.999, 0–0.001 and 0.9973, respectively). Such a developed model can have its application as a foundation for monitoring and managing solutions of large and heterogeneous IoT environments such as Industrial IoT, smart home, and similar.",

        "abstract": "Health diseases have been issued seriously harmful in human life due to different dehydrated food and disturbance of working environment in the organization. Precise prediction and diagnosis of disease become a more serious and challenging task for primary deterrence, recognition, and treatment. Thus, based on the above challenges, we proposed the Medical Things (MT) and machine learning models to solve the healthcare problems with appropriate services in disease supervising, forecast, and diagnosis. We developed a prediction framework with machine learning approaches to get different categories of classification for predicted disease. The framework is designed by the fuzzy model with a decision tree to lessen the data complexity. We considered heart disease for experiments and experimental evaluation determined the prediction for categories of classification. The number of decision trees (M) with samples (MS), leaf node (ML), and learning rate (I) is determined as MS=20, ML=3, I=0.1, then mean test score(m) is 20.",

        "title": "A Machine Learning Model for Predicting Performance of Gamified Software Test Specialist",
        "abstract": "Gamification is one of the new trend in software development and it has already gained a well-deserved popularity in finance, healthcare, education and even manufacturing. Software testing is a continuous cycle layered with several stages and spanning across multiple types of testing. Teams need to design test suites and implement test execution methodologies in each stage of development. For this reason, software testing teams comprise many individuals skilled in different aspects of software testing. The inclusion of gamification in this course can lead to positive benefits based on the idea that it is used to influence behavior. This paper presents an preliminary study of Machine Learning (ML) approach for predicting performance gamification of software tester specialists under a gamified testing environment. ImonaGame is a software company that delivers gamification as a service for software testing team of 30 members with different static and dynamic data. User behavior collected in dynamic data sets was classified into categories by deconstructing complex activities into behavior chains using supervision of domain experts. The classification approach was centered on the system’s testing processes’ performance objectives and potential for encouragement or dissuasion. Motivators and obstacles for the target activity and its behaviors will be found when the model has been developed. After conducting preliminary research, it is possible to determine whether gameful design is an effective and efficient tactic for achieving the desired result by analyzing needs, motives, and obstacles. The source data was classified target data in four categories such as I: Static feature (personal information; 4), II: Daily feature (gamification elements; 14), III: Mission feature (points; 7 sources) and IV: Cumulative futures (Sum of daily and mission features; 13).",

        "abstract": "The comparative study in this review paper covered several phases of predictive modelling and examining the efficacy of different models for stroke prediction. Thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and strict data pretreatment were part of the initial look into, which made sure the model building process had a strong foundation. A thorough examination of the prediction performance of a various machine learning algorithms was made possible by the analysis, which included everything from traditional classifiers to state-of-the-art ensemble techniques. Lazy Predictor was used for benchmarking and initial model selection, which made it simple to identify the best-performing algorithms. These models' predictive accuracy was further improved by subsequent fine-tuning, which improved their appropriateness for stroke prediction tasks. In addition, the investigation of ensemble learning strategies cleared the way for the creation of hybrid models, which combine the advantages of distinct classifiers to produce better prediction results. The comparison analysis yielded useful insights that influence the selection of classification models for stroke prediction by healthcare researchers and practitioners. Stakeholders can embrace and apply ML approaches for stroke prediction with more knowledge if the study's findings are summarized. This will lead to improved medical outcomes and therapy.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic disease spread by SARS-COV-2 single-strand structure RNA virus belongs to the 7th generation of the coronavirus family. Following an unusual replication mechanism, its extreme ease of transmissibility has put many counties under lockdown. With a cure for the infection uncertain in the near future, the pressure currently lies in the current healthcare infrastructure, policies, government activities, and behaviour of the people to contain the virus. This research seeks to understand the spreading patterns of the COVID-19 virus through exponential growth modelling and identifies countries that have showed an initial sign of containment until 26th March 2020. Post identification of countries that have shown an initial sign of containment, predictive supervised machine learning models were built with infrastructure, environment, policies, and infection related independent variables. For the purpose, COVID-19 infection data across 42 countries were used. Logistic regression results shows a positive significant relationship of healthcare infrastructure and lockdown policies on the sign of early containment in countries. Machine learning models based on logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machines were developed and are seen to have accuracies between 76.2% to 92.9% to predict early sign of infection containment. Other policies and activities taken by countries to contain the infection are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "The field of medical analysis is often referred to be a valuable source of rich information. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the major causes of death all around the world therefore early detection of CHD can help reduce these rates. The challenge lies in the complexity of the data and correlations when it comes to prediction using conventional techniques. The aim of this research is to use the historical medical data to predict CHD using Machine Learning (ML) technology. The scope of this research is limited to using three supervised learning techniques namely Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), to discover correlations in CHD data that might help improving the prediction rate. Using the South African Heart Disease dataset of 462 instances, intelligent models are derived by the considered ML techniques using 10-fold cross validation. Empirical results using different performance evaluation measures report that probabilistic models derived by NB are promising in detecting CHD.",

        "abstract": "Research on prompting has shown excellent performance with little or even no supervised training across many tasks. However, prompting for machine translation is still under-explored in the literature. We fill this gap by offering a systematic study on prompting strategies for translation, examining various factors for prompt template and demonstration example selection. We further explore the use of monolingual data and the feasibility of cross-lingual, cross-domain, and sentence-to-document transfer learning in prompting. Extensive experiments with GLM-130B (Zeng et al., 2022) as the testbed show that 1) the number and the quality of prompt examples matter, where using suboptimal examples degenerates translation; 2) several features of prompt examples, such as semantic similarity, show significant Spearman correlation with their prompting performance; yet, none of the correlations are strong enough; 3) using pseudo parallel prompt examples constructed from monolingual data via zero-shot prompting could improve translation; and 4) improved performance is achievable by transferring knowledge from prompt examples selected in other settings. We finally provide an analysis on the model outputs and discuss several problems that prompting still suffers from.",

        "title": "Predictive hospital site selection model using machine learning techniques",
        "abstract": "Globally, countries are faced with healthcare challenges that vary from one to the next. While health service delivery challenges are more often seen in countries with a very high HumanDevelopment Index (HDI), inefficient healthcare intervention challenges attract more attention in those with a low HDI. Health systems and infrastructure interventions are major challenges for most countries in Africa. The conventional or traditional approach to situating hospitals has been subjected to the unreliable intuition of experts and perhaps biased by nepotism, favoritism, and tribalism of recognized interest. In this research, we prioritize health factors for hospital site predictions. A hospital is a healthcare intervention infrastructure that should meet the healthcare needs of people where it is located. Many hospital site selection researchers have considered other important factors such as geographical, economic, and socio-demographic factors. However, healthcare factors that will specifically address the healthcare needs of people in that locality have not been mentioned. This paper considers a robust, viable, reliable, and dependable approach to solve the specific problem of selecting the best location for building new hospitals based on the specific healthcare needs of the location for improved healthcare service delivery. We propose a supervised machine learning approach to predict the most suitable sites for building new hospitals. Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression (LGR), and Decision Tree (DT) machine learning algorithm are used to predict the optimal location for hospital site selection on the basis of various attributes used in the dataset. The dataset was extracted from clinical exploratory data using parameters such as reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health, Infectious diseases, Noncommunicable diseases, Adequate sanitation, Service capacity, and access to essential medicines as a Universal Health Coverage (UHC) standard by World Health Organization (WHO). The model is implemented using Python programming language. The system will improve health systems and infrastructural interventions, thereby enabling efficient healthcare service delivery in developing countries, especially in Africa. ",

Examples include detection of fraudulent transaction in banking or ﬁnancial domain, detection of cyber-attacks in networking environment, detection of abnormal behavior of vital signs of patient in healthcare domain. Also, detection of anomalies with respect to time of arrival of data is a crucial in deciding the accomplishment of successful countermeasures. Selection of suitable algorithm or method for detection of anomaly is also equally important for successful detection of anomalies. In this paper it is proposed to compare the performance of two different algorithms, namely, Isolation Forest (unsupervised) and Random Forest (supervised) by varying the operating parameters of the algorithms. Experiment is carried out using benchmark dataset that belongs to healthcare domain. The data is preprocessed for missing values and then detection accuracy of algorithm is analyzed with respect to number of records. Results are discussed.",

        "title": "The effects of class rarity on the evaluation of supervised healthcare fraud detection models",
        "abstract": "The United States healthcare system produces an enormous volume of data with a vast number of financial transactions generated by physicians administering healthcare services. This makes healthcare fraud difficult to detect, especially when there are considerably less fraudulent transactions (documented and readily available) than non-fraudulent. The ability to successfully detect fraudulent activities in healthcare, given such discrepancies, can garner up to $350 billion in recovered monetary losses. In machine learning, when one class has a substantially larger number of instances (majority) compared to the other (minority), this is known as class imbalance. In this paper, we focus specifically on Medicare, utilizing three ‘Big Data’ Medicare claims datasets with real-world fraudulent physicians. We create a training and test dataset for all three Medicare parts, both separately and combined, to assess fraud detection performance. To emulate class rarity, which indicates particularly severe levels of class imbalance, we generate additional datasets, by removing fraud instances, to determine the effects of rarity on fraud detection performance. Before a machine learning model can be distributed for real-world use, a performance evaluation is necessary to determine the best configuration (e.g. learner, class sampling ratio) and whether the associated error rates are low, indicating good detection rates. With our research, we demonstrate the effects of severe class imbalance and rarity using a training and testing (Train_Test) evaluation method via a hold-out set, and provide our recommendations based on the supervised machine learning results. Additionally, we repeat the same experiments using Cross-Validation, and determine it is a viable substitute for Medicare fraud detection. For machine learning with the severe class imbalance datasets, we found that, as expected, fraud detection performance decreased as the fraudulent instances became more rare. We apply Random Undersampling to both Train_Test and Cross-Validation, for all original and generated datasets, in order to assess potential improvements in fraud detection by reducing the adverse effects of class imbalance and rarity. Overall, our results indicate that the Train_Test method significantly outperforms Cross-Validation.",

        "abstract": "This paper revolves around a classification use case of machine learning in which the intention is to predict\nthe possibility of a heart disease in an individual given certain parameters. Machine Learning is extensively\nbeing used across the world. The healthcare industry has also commenced leveraging these data driven\ntechniques. Machine Learning can play a vital role in predicting the likelihood of locomotor disorders, Heart\nailments and more such diseases because machine learning is well known for its use cases in classifying,\ncategorizing and predicting. Such information, if predicted well, can provide key foresight to doctors who can\nhence mould their diagnosis and course of treatment per patient basis. The main advantage of using machine\nlearning in healthcare is its ability to parse and process huge datasets which are beyond the scope of human\nabilities, and then accurately convert the derived analysis of that data into clinical insights that can aid\nmedical practitioners round the globe in planning stratergies for providing care to patients, ultimately leading\nto more promising results, reduced costs of care and last but not the least , increased patient satiation and\nresponse/recovery. To simplify and solve this problem, solutions were provided using multiple supervised\nlearning algorithms like logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, random forests, decision trees, support vector\nmachines and K-nearest neighbours. The best accuracy was seen using random forests.",

        "title": "Justification-Based Reliability in Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "With the advent of Deep Learning, the field of machine learning (ML) has surpassed human-level performance on diverse classification tasks. At the same time, there is a stark need to characterize and quantify reliability of a model's prediction on individual samples. This is especially true in applications of such models in safety-critical domains of industrial control and healthcare. To address this need, we link the question of reliability of a model's individual prediction to the epistemic uncertainty of the model's prediction. More specifically, we extend the theory of Justified True Belief (JTB) in epistemology, created to study the validity and limits of human-acquired knowledge, towards characterizing the validity and limits of knowledge in supervised classifiers. We present an analysis of neural network classifiers linking the reliability of its prediction on a test input to characteristics of the support gathered from the input and hidden layers of the network. We hypothesize that the JTB analysis exposes the epistemic uncertainty (or ignorance) of a model with respect to its inference, thereby allowing for the inference to be only as strong as the justification permits. We explore various forms of support (for e.g., k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and ℓp-norm based) generated for an input, using the training data to construct a justification for the prediction with that input. Through experiments conducted on simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can provide reliability for individual predictions and characterize regions where such reliability cannot be ascertained.",

        "title": "Weakly Supervised Learning for Categorization of Medical Inquiries for Customer Service Effectiveness",
        "abstract": "With the growing unstructured data in healthcare and pharmaceutical, there has been a drastic adoption of natural language processing for generating actionable insights from text data sources. One of the key areas of our exploration is the Medical Information function within our organization. We receive a significant amount of medical information inquires in the form of unstructured text. An enterprise-level solution must deal with medical information interactions via multiple communication channels which are always nuanced with a variety of keywords and emotions that are unique to the pharmaceutical industry. There is a strong need for an effective solution to leverage the contextual knowledge of the medical information business along with digital tenants of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to build an automated and scalable process that generates real-time insights on conversation categories. The traditional supervised learning methods rely on a huge set of manually labeled training data and this dataset is difficult to attain due to high labeling costs. Thus, the solution is incomplete without its ability to self-learn and improve. This necessitates techniques to automatically build relevant training data using a weakly supervised approach from textual inquiries across consumers, healthcare professionals, sales, and service providers. The solution has two fundamental layers of NLP and machine learning. The first layer leverages heuristics and knowledgebase to identify the potential categories and build an annotated training data. The second layer, based on machine learning and deep learning, utilizes the training data generated using the heuristic approach for identifying categories and sub-categories associated with verbatim. Here, we present a novel approach harnessing the power of weakly supervised learning combined with multi-class classification for improved categorization of medical information inquiries.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have huge potential to efficiently manage the automated operation of the internet of things (IoT) nodes deployed in smart cities. In smart cities, the major IoT applications are smart traffic monitoring, smart waste management, smart buildings and patient healthcare monitoring. The small size IoT nodes based on low power Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) standard and wireless sensor networks (WSN) (IEEE 802.15.4) standard are generally used for transmission of data to a remote location using gateways. The WSN based IoT (WSN-IoT) design problems include network coverage and connectivity issues, energy consumption, bandwidth requirement, network lifetime maximization, communication protocols and state of the art infrastructure. In this paper, the authors propose machine learning methods as an optimization tool for regular WSN-IoT nodes deployed in smart city applications. As per the author’s knowledge, this is the first in-depth literature survey of all ML techniques in the field of low power consumption WSN-IoT for smart cities. The results of this unique survey article show that the supervised learning algorithms have been most widely used (61%) as compared to reinforcement learning (27%) and unsupervised learning (12%) for smart city applications.",

        "title": "Efficient Cyber Attack Detection on the Internet of Medical Things-Smart Environment Based on Deep Recurrent Neural Network and Machine Learning Algorithms",
        "abstract": "Information and communication technology (ICT) advancements have altered the entire computing paradigm. As a result of these improvements, numerous new channels of communication are being created, one of which is the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT has recently emerged as cutting-edge technology for creating smart environments. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a subset of the IoT, in which medical equipment exchange information with each other to exchange sensitive information. These developments enable the healthcare business to maintain a higher level of touch and care for its patients. Security is seen as a significant challenge in whatsoever technology’s reliance based on the IoT. Security difficulties occur owing to the various potential attacks posed by attackers. There are numerous security concerns, such as remote hijacking, impersonation, denial of service attacks, password guessing, and man-in-the-middle. In the event of such attacks, critical data associated with IoT connectivity may be revealed, altered, or even rendered inaccessible to authorized users. As a result, it turns out to be critical to safeguard the IoT/IoMT ecosystem against malware assaults. The main goal of this study is to demonstrate how a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and supervised machine learning models (random forest, decision tree, KNN, and ridge classifier) can be utilized to develop an efficient and effective IDS in the IoMT environment for classifying and forecasting unexpected cyber threats. Preprocessing and normalization of network data are performed. Following that, we optimized features using a bio-inspired particle swarm algorithm. On the standard data for intrusion detection, a thorough evaluation of experiments in DRNN and other SML is performed. It was established through rigorous testing that the proposed SML model outperforms existing approaches with an accuracy of 99.76%.",

        "title": "Proteomics and Machine Learning Approaches Reveal a Set of Prognostic Markers for COVID-19 Severity With Drug Repurposing Potential",
        "abstract": "The pestilential pathogen SARS-CoV-2 has led to a seemingly ceaseless pandemic of COVID-19. The healthcare sector is under a tremendous burden, thus necessitating the prognosis of COVID-19 severity. This in-depth study of plasma proteome alteration provides insights into the host physiological response towards the infection and also reveals the potential prognostic markers of the disease. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we performed deep plasma proteome analysis in a cohort of 71 patients (20 COVID-19 negative, 18 COVID-19 non-severe, and 33 severe) to understand the disease dynamics. Of the 1200 proteins detected in the patient plasma, 38 proteins were identified to be differentially expressed between non-severe and severe groups. The altered plasma proteome revealed significant dysregulation in the pathways related to peptidase activity, regulated exocytosis, blood coagulation, complement activation, leukocyte activation involved in immune response, and response to glucocorticoid biological processes in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we employed supervised machine learning (ML) approaches using a linear support vector machine model to identify the classifiers of patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19. The model used a selected panel of 20 proteins and classified the samples based on the severity with a classification accuracy of 0.84. Putative biomarkers such as angiotensinogen and SERPING1 and ML-derived classifiers including the apolipoprotein B, SERPINA3, and fibrinogen gamma chain were validated by targeted mass spectrometry-based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays. We also employed an in silico screening approach against the identified target proteins for the therapeutic management of COVID-19. We shortlisted two FDA-approved drugs, namely, selinexor and ponatinib, which showed the potential of being repurposed for COVID-19 therapeutics. Overall, this is the first most comprehensive plasma proteome investigation of COVID-19 patients from the Indian population, and provides a set of potential biomarkers for the disease severity progression and targets for therapeutic interventions.",

        "title": "Sparsifying machine learning models identify stable subsets of predictive features for behavioral detection of autism",
        "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis can be delayed due in part to the time required for administration of standard exams, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Shorter and potentially mobilized approaches would help to alleviate bottlenecks in the healthcare system. Previous work using machine learning suggested that a subset of the behaviors measured by ADOS can achieve clinically acceptable levels of accuracy. Here we expand on this initial work to build sparse models that have higher potential to generalize to the clinical population.MethodsWe assembled a collection of score sheets for two ADOS modules, one for children with phrased speech (Module 2; 1319 ASD cases, 70 controls) and the other for children with verbal fluency (Module 3; 2870 ASD cases, 273 controls). We used sparsity/parsimony enforcing regularization techniques in a nested cross validation grid search to select features for 17 unique supervised learning models, encoding missing values as additional indicator features. We augmented our feature sets with gender and age to train minimal and interpretable classifiers capable of robust detection of ASD from non-ASD.ResultsBy applying 17 unique supervised learning methods across 5 classification families tuned for sparse use of features and to be within 1 standard error of the optimal model, we find reduced sets of 10 and 5 features used in a majority of models. We tested the performance of the most interpretable of these sparse models, including Logistic Regression with L2 regularization or Linear SVM with L1 regularization. We obtained an area under the ROC curve of 0.95 for ADOS Module 3 and 0.93 for ADOS Module 2 with less than or equal to 10 features.ConclusionsThe resulting models provide improved stability over previous machine learning efforts to minimize the time complexity of autism detection due to regularization and a small parameter space. These robustness techniques yield classifiers that are sparse, interpretable and that have potential to generalize to alternative modes of autism screening, diagnosis and monitoring, possibly including analysis of short home videos.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare is an integral component in people’s lives, especially for the rising elderly population, and must be affordable. Medicare is one such healthcare program. Claims fraud is a major contributor to increased healthcare costs, but its impact can be lessened through fraud detection. In this paper, we compare several machine learning methods to detect Medicare fraud. We perform a comparative study with supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid machine learning approaches using four performance metrics and class imbalance reduction via oversampling and an 80-20 undersampling method. We group the 2015 Medicare data into provider types, with fraud labels from the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities database. Our results show that the successful detection of fraudulent providers is possible, with the 80-20 sampling method demonstrating the best performance across the learners. Furthermore, supervised methods performed better than unsupervised or hybrid methods, but these results varied based on the class imbalance sampling technique and provider type.",

If recent trends are allowed to continue, 23.6 million people will die from heart disease in coming 2030. The healthcare industry collects large amounts of heart disease data which unfortunately are not “mined” to discover hidden information for effective decision making. In this paper, study of PCA has been done which finds the minimum number of attributes required to enhance the precision of various supervised machine learning algorithms. The purpose of this research is to study supervised machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease. Data mining has number of important techniques like categorization, preprocessing. Diabetic is a life threatening disease which prevent in several urbanized as well as emergent countries like India. The data categorization is diabetic patients datasets which is developed by collecting data from hospital repository consists of 1865 instances with dissimilar attributes. The examples in the dataset are two categories of blood tests, urine tests. In this research paper we discuss a variety of algorithm approaches of data mining that have been utilized for diabetic disease prediction. Data mining is a well known practice used by health organizations for classification of diseases such as diabetes and cancer in bioinformatics research.",

        "abstract": "The grouping of clusters is an important task to perform for the initial stage of clinical implication and diagnosis of a disease. The researchers performed evaluation work on instance distributions and cluster groups for epidemic classification, based on manual data extracted from various repositories, in order to evaluate Euclidean points. This study was carried out on Weka (3.9.2) using 281 real-life health records of diabetes mellitus patients including males and females of ages>20 and <87, who were simultaneously suffering from other chronic disease symptoms, in Nigeria from 2017 to 2018. Updated plugins of K-mean and self-organizing map(SOM) machine learning algorithms were used to cluster the data class of mellitus type for initial clinical implications. The results of the K-mean assessment were built in 0.21 seconds with nine iterations for “type” and eight for “class” attributes. Out of 281 instances, 87 (30.97%) were classified as negative and 194 (69.03%) as positive in the testing on the Euclidean space plot. By assessment for Euclidean points, SOM discovered the search space in a more effective way, but K-mean positioning potencies are impulsive in convergence. This study is important for epidemiological disease diagnosis in countries with a high epidemic risk and low socioeconomic status.",

        "abstract": "An object-based cloud storage system is a storage platform where big data is managed through the internet and data is considered as an object. A smart storage system should be able to handle the big data variety property by recommending the storage space for each data type automatically. Machine learning can help make a storage system automatic. This article proposes a classification engine framework for this purpose by utilizing a machine learning strategy. A feature selection approach wrapped with a classifier is proposed to automatically predict the proper storage space for the incoming big data. It helps build an automatic storage space recommendation system for an object-based cloud storage platform. To find out a suitable combination of feature selection algorithms and classifiers for the proposed classification engine, a comparative study of different supervised feature selection algorithms (i.e., Fisher score, F-score, Lll21) from three categories (similarity, statistical, sparse learning) associated with various classifiers (i.e., SVM, K-NN, Neural Network) is performed. We illustrate our study using RSoS system as it provides a cloud storage platform for the healthcare data as experimental big data by considering its variety property. The experiments confirm that Lll21 feature selection combined with K-NN classifier provides better performance than the others.",

        "abstract": "In the most advanced healthcare application environment, the use of IoT technologies brings convenience to medical professionals and patients, since they have applied to health areas. In IoT, Body sensor network (BSN) technology plays a vital role in the healthcare system where lightweight wireless and low-powered sensor nodes used for monitoring the patients. In this paper, we propose a healthcare system using IoT and BSN technology. This system includes various sensors like pulse rate sensor, temperature sensor, and blood pressure sensor. These sensors sense the parameters and send the data to the controller. According to the conditions, the buzzer will on as temperature exceeds the given range. It carries the sensed data to the LCD to display on it. At the same time, data send to doctors using the internet, so that they can give quick and proper solution in real-time. Many patients suffer because of not getting the timely and appropriate solution and help for their problem. Proposed system hence offers the real-time solution and help in case of emergency. This system is convenient; therefore, a person can carry it with them. Thus continuous health checking is possible. The system also predicts the disease for a particular patient base on current reading using various supervised learning algorithms",

        "abstract": "\n \n \n The mobile and wearable technology and artificial technology are rapidly developing for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection. Nonetheless, how these smart technologies combine to improve AF prediction, rather than detection, remains unclear.\n \n \n \n To investigate a machine-learning fusion approach beyond photoplethysmographic (PPG)-based AF detection for predicting AF onset.\n \n \n \n There are 2,120,210 individuals who used PPG-based smart devices (Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) to monitor their pulse rhythm from pre-mAFA study (Huawei heart study) for AF screening across China between October 26, 2018 and March 26, 2021. Two machine-learning (ML) models, short-term model and long-term mode, have been developed based on PPG continuing monitoring signals to predict AF episode at 4h or 8h before AF onset respectively, with supervised ML (XGBoost and LightGBM) techniques, and further optimized with feature extension and hyperparameter optimization, respectively. The probabilities of AF onset calculated by both short-term and long-term models with timely PPG monitoring signals would be further input into Warning Decision Module, combined with prior predicting risk of AF onset, then the real risk ratio of predicting AF onset in advance would be output by the fusion module (Figure). The predictive ability of ML models, classified by time to last AF onset, has been validated among individuals involving in AF screening from pre-mAFA study between March 19 to March 26, compared to identified AF by PPG monitoring.\n \n \n \n There were 6294 (mean age ± standard deviation, 51.6±16.0 years old, 5439 male) individuals with identified AF, with total 142,518 identified AF episodes by PPG. The 107,864 identified AF were utilized to validate ML fusion approach for the prediction of AF, given effective PPG monitoring signals before identified AF episodes for ML models. There were 443,630 PPG monitoring signals before identified AF episodes and 563,309 non-AF PPG monitoring signals of ML models.\n The sensitivity of ML fusion approach for the prediction of AF onset was 94.04%, the specificity of 96.35%, and the recall of 94.04%, respectively (Table). When time to last AF onset over 24 hours, the sensitivity of ML fusion approach for AF onset at 8h in advance was 85.73%, specificity of 96.62%, and recall of 85.73%, respectively (Table).\n \n \n \n The ML fusion approach based on PPG-smart devices provided the effective early 'alters' of AF onset in advance in this large cohort, which may help the early 'upstream' management of AF.\n \n \n \n Type of funding sources: Public grant(s) – National budget only.

        "abstract": "While experts have recognised the significance and necessity of social media integration in healthcare, no systematic method has been devised in Malaysia or Southeast Asia to include social media input into the hospital quality improvement process. The goal of this work is to explain how to develop a machine learning system for classifying Facebook reviews of public hospitals in Malaysia by using service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions and sentiment analysis. We developed a Machine Learning Quality Classifier (MLQC) based on the SERVQUAL model and a Machine Learning Sentiment Analyzer (MLSA) by manually annotated multiple batches of randomly chosen reviews. Logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and other methods were used to train the classifiers. The performance of each classifier was tested using 5-fold cross validation. For topic classification, the average F1-score was between 0.687 and 0.757 for all models. In a 5-fold cross validation of each SERVQUAL dimension and in sentiment analysis, SVM consistently outperformed other methods. The study demonstrates how to use supervised learning to automatically identify SERVQUAL domains and sentiments from patient experiences on a hospital’s Facebook page. Malaysian healthcare providers can gather and assess data on patient care via the use of these content analysis technology to improve hospital quality of care.",

Predictive tools can help mitigate these effects by encouraging the patients’ and healthcare system’s proactivity. This research work uses supervised learning techniques to build a predictive model of the healthcare status of a chronic patient, using Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs) as a measure of chronicity and prescription and diagnosis data as predictors. The model is addressed to the whole population in our healthcare system regardless of the disease, as data used are widely available in a consistent way for all patients. We explore different ways to encode data that are appropriate for machine learning. Results suggest that these data alone can be used to build accurate models, and show that, in our set, prescription information has a higher predictive value than diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal quality assessment (SQA) ensures improved measurements of various surrogate cardiovascular measurements like heart rate, SpO2, blood pressure, cardiac output and many more and as well reduces false alrams in ambulatory measurements. Although PPG SQA (PSQA) is a well researched area, but multiclass prediction of signal quality and its hardware implementation is limited. In this paper, a new non-segmenting approach for multiclass PSQA is presented with an optimal set of seven time-frequency domain features in conjuction with supervised classifiers to identify clean, partly clean and corrupted PPG data. The present work was carried out in three major stages- signal (dataset) acquisition, feature extraction and 3-class classification using random forest classifier. The technique was evaluated with volunteers’ data, MIMIC-III data from PhysioNet, CSL data, and combined data and achieved an overall average accuracy of 96.8% with good (0.98 or above) sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, precision and recall. On-device implementation of the proposed PSQA was accomplished using 7.2 h of PPG dataset on a quad-core Broadcom BCM 2837 controller with 1.2 GHz, supported by 1 GB RAM-based standalone device, with an accuracy of 97.09%. The latency and the peak memory requirement of the implementation was 0.81 s and 19 kB respectively to process 3 s PPG data. The present technique may be integrated as a part of a remote healthcare system using wearable sensors.",

        "title": "A Machine Learning Approach for Heart Attack Prediction",
        "abstract": "A heart attack also known as cardiac arrest, diversify various conditions impacting the heart and became one of the chief-reason for death worldwide over the last few decades. Approximately, 31% of total deaths globally are due to CVDs. It constitutes the pinnacle of chronic processes which involve complex interactions between risk factors which can and cannot be improved. Most of the instances or cases of cardiovascular diseases can be allocated to revisable risk factors where most of the instances are considered preventable. ML became the enhancing approach for the evolution of predictive models in health care industries and was decided to test various algorithms to check what extent their prediction scores estimate or ameliorate upon the results acquired. Researchers deploy various machine learning and data mining techniques over a set of enormous data of cardiovascular patients to attain the prediction for heart attacks before their occurrence for helping healthcare industries and professionals. This research comprises various Supervised ML classifiers like, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression that have been used to deploy a model for Myocardial Infarction prediction. It uses the existing datasets from the Framingham database and others from the database of the UCI Heart repository. This research intends to ideate the prediction for probabilities of occurrence of a heart attack in the patients. These classifiers have been deployed in pipeline approach of machine learning to attain the prediction using both ways i.e., without optimizations and feature transformations as well as vice-versa. The results impersonate that the Gradient Boosting classifier is achieving the highest accuracy score in such a way that prediction used by our model is of binary form in where 1 means a chance of heart attack and 0 means no chance. Some of the most influential attributes are chest pain type among which the typical angina is the most influential and asymptotic chest pain is least, cholesterol level in which the level greater than 200mg/dl are more prone, increased heart rate, thal, and age. It is concluded that premature heart attack is preventable in 80% of the total cases just by using a healthy diet along with regular exercises and not using tobacco products also the person who drinks more than 5 glasses of water daily are less likely to develop attacks. The medical checkup of Blood-pressure level, cholesterol level and heart rate on daily basis along with meditation can help you prevent the major heart attacks.",

        "abstract": "Passwords are a vital component of system security. Though there are many alternatives to passwords for access control, password is the more compellingly authenticating the identity in many applications. They provide a simple, direct means of protecting a system and they represent the identity of an individual for a system. The big vulnerability of passwords lies in their nature. Users are consistently told that a strong password is essential these days to protect private data as there are so many ways for an unauthorized person with little technical knowledge or skill to learn the passwords of legitimate users. Thus it is important for organizations to recognize the vulnerabilities to which passwords are subjected, and develop strong policies governing the creation and use of passwords to ensure that those vulnerabilities are not exploited. In this work password strength prediction is modeled as classification task and supervised machine learning techniques were employed. Widely used supervised machine learning techniques namely C 4.5 Decision tree classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, Naïve Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine were used for learning the model. The results of the models were compared and observed that SVM performs well. The results of the models were also compared with the existing password strength checking tools. The findings show that machine learning approach has substantial capability to classify the extreme cases – Strong and weak passwords.",

Similarly, supervised learning approach is one essential operation under machine learning that has always contributed in the area of healthcare and diagnostics. However, there are still some problems associated with the detection and classification of complex disease condition that is yet to be solved. The proposed system introduces a novel supervised learning approach along with a novel feature extraction scheme which is more progressive and less iterative. The proposed system considers a case study to perform classification of breast cancer using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) where it is subjected to normalization first followed by a novel segmentation process that compliments the classification operation too. The study outcome shows that the proposed system offers better classification performance in contrast to existing supervised approaches.",

        "title": "What Is the Accuracy of Three Different Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Clinical Outcomes After Shoulder Arthroplasty?",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMachine learning techniques can identify complex relationships in large healthcare datasets and build prediction models that better inform physicians in ways that can assist in patient treatment decision-making. In the domain of shoulder arthroplasty, machine learning appears to have the potential to anticipate patients' results after surgery, but this has not been well explored.\n\n\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES\n(1) What is the accuracy of machine learning to predict the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (ASES), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Constant, global shoulder function, and VAS pain scores, as well as active abduction, forward flexion, and external rotation at 1 year, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, and more than 5 years after anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA)? (2) What is the accuracy of machine learning to identify whether a patient will achieve clinical improvement that exceeds the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) threshold for each outcome measure? (3) What is the accuracy of machine learning to identify whether a patient will achieve clinical improvement that exceeds the substantial clinical benefit threshold for each outcome measure?\n\n\nMETHODS\nA machine learning analysis was conducted on a database of 7811 patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty of one prosthesis design to create predictive models for multiple clinical outcome measures. Excluding patients with revisions, fracture indications, and hemiarthroplasty resulted in 6210 eligible primary aTSA and rTSA patients, of whom 4782 patients with 11,198 postoperative follow-up visits had sufficient preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data to train and test the predictive models. Preoperative clinical data from 1895 primary aTSA patients and 2887 primary rTSA patients were analyzed using three commercially available supervised machine learning techniques: linear regression, XGBoost, and Wide and Deep, to train and test predictive models for the ASES, UCLA, Constant, global shoulder function, and VAS pain scores, as well as active abduction, forward flexion, and external rotation. Our primary study goal was to quantify the accuracy of three machine learning techniques to predict each outcome measure at multiple postoperative timepoints after aTSA and rTSA using the mean absolute error between the actual and predicted values. Our secondary study goals were to identify whether a patient would experience clinical improvement greater than the MCID and substantial clinical benefit anchor-based thresholds of patient satisfaction for each outcome measure as quantified by the model classification parameters of precision, recall, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating curve.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEach machine learning technique demonstrated similar accuracy to predict each outcome measure at each postoperative point for both aTSA and rTSA, though small differences in prediction accuracy were observed between techniques. Across all postsurgical timepoints, the Wide and Deep technique was associated with the smallest mean absolute error and predicted the postoperative ASES score to ± 10.1 to 11.3 points, the UCLA score to ± 2.5 to 3.4, the Constant score to ± 7.3 to 7.9, the global shoulder function score to ± 1.0 to 1.4, the VAS pain score to ± 1.2 to 1.4, active abduction to ± 18 to 21°, forward elevation to ± 15 to 17°, and external rotation to ± 10 to 12°. These models also accurately identified the patients who did and did not achieve clinical improvement that exceeded the MCID (93% to 99% accuracy for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and 85% to 94% for pain, function, and ROM measures) and substantial clinical benefit (82% to 93% accuracy for PROMs and 78% to 90% for pain, function, and ROM measures) thresholds.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMachine learning techniques can use preoperative data to accurately predict clinical outcomes at multiple postoperative points after shoulder arthroplasty and accurately risk-stratify patients by preoperatively identifying who may and who may not achieve MCID and substantial clinical benefit improvement thresholds for each outcome measure.\n\n\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE\nThree different commercially available machine learning techniques were used to train and test models that predicted clinical outcomes after aTSA and rTSA; this device-type comparison was performed to demonstrate how predictive modeling techniques can be used in the near future to help answer unsolved clinical questions and augment decision-making to improve outcomes after shoulder arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "Heart Failure (HF) is a syndrome that reduces patients’ quality of life, and has severe impacts on healthcare systems worldwide, such as the high rate of readmissions. In order to reduce the readmissions and improve patients’ quality of life, several studies are trying to assess the risk of a patient to be readmitted, so that taking right actions clinicians can prevent patient deterioration and readmission. Predictive models have the ability to identify patients at high risk. Henceforth, this paper studies predictive models to determine the risk of a HF patient to be readmitted in the next 30 days after discharge. We present two different approaches. In the first one, we combine unsupervised and supervised classification and achieved AUC score of 0.64. In the second one, we combine decision tree and Naïve Bayes classifiers and achieved AUC score of 0.61. Additionally, we discover that the results improve when training the predictive models with different readmission’s threshold outcome, reaching the AUC score of 0.73 when applying the first approach.",

        "abstract": "The advancement in information technology has been on the increase in the recent past with the expansion of text data dissemination in the form of news, medical reports, product reviews, and social media posts among others, the increase in text data has made text mining and classification mandatory. In the last decade a lot of attempts have been undertaken to solve the text classification problems employing machine learning and deep learning approaches both supervised and unsupervised. In this context, our research proposes High-Resolution NLP for Social Healthcare Networks (HiN-TC), a state-of-the-art text classification approach. In our research, data cleaning and normalization are done using Min-Max with Zero-Mean Rescaling Normalization, feature selection is done using Echelon Adaptive Poplar Algorithm, and feature extraction is done using Bi-Consolidation Transformer that captures key patterns in the text. It is supposed to classify the data with good accuracy using Causal Dilated Cosine Architecture and we have optimized it using Precision-Weighted Leadership Navigator for improved performance. This framework is applied to the COVID-19 vaccination Twitter dataset to help get more superior understanding of social healthcare trends. Our methodology demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving a 98.5% increase in classification accuracy, a 96.3% reduction in text processing time, and a 97.1% boost in scalability. These outcomes suggest the capability of the HiN-TC to deliver a more profound understanding of the social healthcare networks and suggest that the presented framework can be effective for the enhancement of the efficiency and accuracy in the computationally extensive range of the NLP methods and applications for the analysis of the large-scale unstructured text data in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Understanding and classifying electromyogram (EMG) signals is of significance for dexterous prosthetic hand control, sign languages, grasp recognition, human-machine interaction, etc.. The existing research of EMG-based hand gesture classification faces the challenges of unsatisfied classification accuracy, insufficient generalization ability, lack of training data and weak robustness. To address these problems, this paper combines unsupervised and supervised learning methods to classify an EMG dataset consisting of 10 classes of hand gestures. To lessen the difficulty of classification, clustering methods including subtractive clustering and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms are employed first to obtain the initial partition of the inputs. In particular, modified FCM algorithm is proposed to accustom the conventional FCM to the multi-class classification problem. Based on the grouping information obtained from clustering, a type of two-step supervised learning approach is proposed. Specifically, a top-classifier and three sub-classifiers integrated with windowing method and majority voting are employed to accomplish the two-step classification. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 100% test accuracy and the strongest robustness compared to the conventional machine learning approaches, which shows the potential for industrial and healthcare applications, such as movement intention detection, grasp recognition and dexterous prostheses control.",

        "abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease has also become one of the serious public health threats worldwide because of its chronic nature and potential progression to End-Stage Renal Disease if left untreated or undiagnosed. This paper aims to utilize machine learning techniques for the early detection of CKD using algorithms such as KNeighborsClassifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Models applied to a data set that contains clinical attributes such as age, blood pressure, and albumin levels after preprocessing for data quality normalization, feature selection, and outlier management. The performance metrics of the developed models were based on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score; Random Forest has the highest diagnostic accuracy at 98.06%. The results show that machine learning models, in this case, Random Forest, are useful for prediction of CKD and may support non-invasive, low-cost early detection in clinical practice. Future work will focus on ensemble and deep learning approaches in order to enhance the robustness of models and their applicability in healthcare.\n\nIndex Terms—Chronic kidney disease , Machine Learning\n\n,KNeighborsClassifier, Support vector machine, Health Infor- matics, Supervised Learning, Medical Data Preprocessing, Early Disease Detection.",

        "title": "Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Heart Disease Prediction",
        "abstract": "In the last few years, cardiovascular diseases have emerged as one of the most common causes of deaths worldwide. The lifestyle changes, eating habits, working cultures etc, has significantly contributed to this alarming issue across the globe including the developed, underdeveloped and developing nations. Early detection of the initial signs of cardiovascular diseases and the continuous medical supervision can help in reducing rising number of patients and eventually the mortality rate. However with limited medical facilities and specialist doctors, it is difficult to continuously monitor the patients and provide consultations. Technological interventions are required to facilitate the patient monitoring and treatment. The healthcare data generated through various medical procedures and continuous patient monitoring can be utilized to develop efficient prediction models for cardiovascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular illnesses can aid in making decisions on life-style changes in high hazard sufferers and in turn lessen the complications, which may be an outstanding milestone inside the field of medicine. This paper studies some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction by using the medical data and historical information. The various techniques are discussed and a comparative analysis of the same is presented. This report compares five common strategies for predicting the chance of heart attack that have been published in the literature. KNN, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are some of the approaches used. Further, the paper also highlights the advantages and disadvantages of using the various techniques for developing the prediction models.",

        "title": "A survey on diabetes risk prediction using machine learning approaches",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition that can lead to a variety of consequences. Diabetes is a condition that is caused by factors such as age, lack of exercise, sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and stress, poor food, and so on. Diabetics are at a higher risk of developing diseases such as heart disease, nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy), eye problems (diabetic retinopathy), kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy), stroke, and so on. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 382 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. By 2035, this number will have risen to 592 million. Every day, a large number of people become victims, and many are ignorant whether they have it or not. It primarily affects individuals between the ages of 25 and 74 years. If diabetes is left untreated and undiagnosed, it can lead to a slew of complications. The emergence of machine learning approaches, on the other hand, solves this crucial issue. Aims and Objectives: The aim was to study the DM and analyze how machine learning algorithms are used to identify the diabetes mellitus at an early stage, which is one of the most serious metabolic disorders in the world today. Methods and Materials: Data was obtained from databases such as Pubmed, IEEE xplore, and INSPEC,and from other secondary sources and primary sources in which methods based on machine learning approaches used in healthcare to predict diabetes at an early stage are reported. Results: After surveying various research papers, it was found that machine learning classification algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) etc shows the best accuracy for predicting diabetes at an early stage. Conclusion: Early detection of diabetes is critical for effective therapy. Many people have no idea whether or not they have it. The full assessment of Machine learning approaches for early diabetes prediction and how to apply a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the dataset to achieve the best accuracy are addressed in this paper.. Furthermore, the work will be expanded and refined to create a more precise and general predictive model for diabetes risk prediction at an early stage. Different metrics can be used to assess performance and for accurate diabetic diagnosis.",

        "title": "Could Machine Learning be used to address Africa’s Challenges?",
        "abstract": "Machine Learning can be both experience and supervised based learning. Machine learning would help in designing system that can be able to take decisions in a more optimized form and also help them to work in most efficient method. In the field of machine learning one considers the important question of how to make machines able to “learn”. Learning in this context is understood as inductive inference, where one observes examples that represent incomplete information about some “statistical phenomenon”. Advanced economies are already using machine learning to solve problems like medical diagnosis, Improving Ecommerce Conversion Rates, traffic congestion, saving cows from bad drivers and improving healthcare, while Africa lags conspicuously behind. African leaders may be aware of this. Whether they possess the foresight to see and take people through is however debatable. This paper discusses how machine learning could be used to address Africa’s challenges by highlighting how some of major challenges can be solved using certain machine learning techniques. Major challenges to Africa continent are identified and machine learning techniques",

        "title": "Authentication based on electrocardiography signals and machine learning",
        "abstract": "Among the information security problems involved in Telemedicine Information Systems (TMIS), the authentication area of the various entities involved has been extensively discussed in recent years and shown a wide range of possibilities. The problems caused by the application of inadequate authentication processes may lead to the death of patients who depend on Mobile Healthcare (M-Health) services. User authentication can be based on several physiological traits (e.g., iris, retina, and fingerprint) for biometric recognition, including electrocardiography (ECG) signals. Some ECG patterns are relatively robust to daily changes associated with normal heart rate variability. In fact, the relative lengths of PQ, QR, and RS intervals, as well as Q, R, and S relative amplitudes constitute individual traits. A few studies have succeeded in using ECG signals as an accurate authentication input and offered some advantages in comparison to biometrics traditional approaches. ECG-based user authentication can be built on Machine Learning (ML) models, used for classification purposes and reductions in distortions caused by misinterpretation of ECG data. Among the ML models adopted for ECG signals classification, ensembles have shown a good research opportunity. Random Under-Sampling Boosting (RUSBoost), a boosting algorithm not yet explored (to the best of our knowledge) for such a problem, can achieve comparatively high performance after a supervised training stage, even from relatively few training examples. This manuscript reports on a comparison of RUSBoost with Nearest Neighbour Search (NNS) regarding the classification of ECG signals for biometric authentication applications. The two ML techniques were compared by a random subsampling technique that considers four analysis metrics, namely accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score. The experimental results showed the better performance of RUSBoost regarding accuracy (97.4%), sensitivity (96.1%) and F1-score (97.4%). On the other hand, NNS provided better precision (99.5%).",

        "title": "Improved Risk Prediction Following Surgery Using Machine Learning Algorithms",
        "abstract": "Background: Machine learning is used to analyze big data, often for the purposes of prediction. Analyzing a patient’s healthcare utilization pattern may provide more precise estimates of risk for adverse events (AE) or death. We sought to characterize healthcare utilization prior to surgery using machine learning for the purposes of risk prediction. Methods: Patients from MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database undergoing elective surgery from 2007–2012 with ≥1 comorbidity were included. All available healthcare claims occurring within six months prior to surgery were assessed. More than 300 predictors were defined by considering all combinations of conditions, encounter types, and timing along with sociodemographic factors. We used a supervised Naive Bayes algorithm to predict risk of AE or death within 90 days of surgery. We compared the model’s performance to the Charlson’s comorbidity index, a commonly used risk prediction tool. Results: Among 410,521 patients (mean age 52, 52 ± 9.4, 56% female), 4.7% had an AE and 0.01% died. The Charlson’s comorbidity index predicted 57% of AE’s and 59% of deaths. The Naive Bayes algorithm predicted 79% of AE’s and 78% of deaths. Claims for cancer, kidney disease, and peripheral vascular disease were the primary drivers of AE or death following surgery. Conclusions: The use of machine learning algorithms improves upon one commonly used risk estimator. Precisely quantifying the risk of an AE following surgery may better inform patient-centered decision-making and direct targeted quality improvement interventions while supporting activities of accountable care organizations that rely on accurate estimates of population risk.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Providing a suitable rehabilitation at home after an acute episode or a chronic disease is a major issue as it helps people to live independently and enhance their quality of life. However, as the rehabilitation period usually lasts some months, the continuity of care is often interrupted in the transition from the hospital to the home. Relieving the healthcare system and personalizing the care or even bringing care to the patients’ home to a greater extent is, in consequence, the superior need. This is why we propose to make use of information technology to come to participatory design driven by users needs and the personalisation of the care pathways enabled by technology. To allow this, patient rehabilitation at home needs to be supported by automatic decision-making, as physicians cannot constantly supervise the rehabilitation process. Thus, we need computer-assisted patient rehabilitation, which monitors the fitness of the current patient plan to detect sub-optimality, proposes personalised changes for a patient and eventually generalizes over patients and proposes better initial plans. Therefore, we will explain the use case of patient rehabilitation at home, the basic challenges in this field and machine learning applications that could address these challenges by technical means.",

        "abstract": "Detection of Heart Disease (HD) by using models of machine learning (ML) is very effective in early stages. The HD treatment and recovery is effective if detected the disease at initial stages. HD identification by machine learning (ML) techniques has been developed to assist the physicians. In this study we proposed an Identification system by using ML models to classify the HD and healthy subjects. Sequential backward selection of feature algorithm was used to select more appropriate features to increase the classification accuracy and reduced the computational time of predictive system. Cleveland heart disease dataset was for evaluation of the system. The dataset 70% used for training and remaining for validation. The proposed system performances have been measured by using evaluation metrics. The experimental results shows that Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) algorithms choose appropriate features and these features increase the accuracy using K-Nearest Neighbor supervised machine learning classifier. The good accuracy of this study suggests that the proposed model will effectively identify the HD and healthy subjects.",

        "title": "The role of machine learning in developing non-magnetic resonance imaging based biomarkers for multiple sclerosis: a systematic review",
        "abstract": "Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition whose symptoms, severity, and progression over time vary enormously among individuals. Ideally, each person living with MS should be provided with an accurate prognosis at the time of diagnosis, precision in initial and subsequent treatment decisions, and improved timeliness in detecting the need to reassess treatment regimens. To manage these three components, discovering an accurate, objective measure of overall disease severity is essential. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can contribute to finding such a clinically useful biomarker of MS through their ability to search and analyze datasets about potential biomarkers at scale. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review to determine how, and in what way, ML has been applied to the study of MS biomarkers on data from sources other than magnetic resonance imaging. Methods Systematic searches through eight databases were conducted for literature published in 2014–2020 on MS and specified ML algorithms. Results Of the 1, 052 returned papers, 66 met the inclusion criteria. All included papers addressed developing classifiers for MS identification or measuring its progression, typically, using hold-out evaluation on subsets of fewer than 200 participants with MS. These classifiers focused on biomarkers of MS, ranging from those derived from omics and phenotypical data (34.5% clinical, 33.3% biological, 23.0% physiological, and 9.2% drug response). Algorithmic choices were dependent on both the amount of data available for supervised ML (91.5%; 49.2% classification and 42.3% regression) and the requirement to be able to justify the resulting decision-making principles in healthcare settings. Therefore, algorithms based on decision trees and support vector machines were commonly used, and the maximum average performance of 89.9% AUC was found in random forests comparing with other ML algorithms. Conclusions ML is applicable to determining how candidate biomarkers perform in the assessment of disease severity. However, applying ML research to develop decision aids to help clinicians optimize treatment strategies and analyze treatment responses in individual patients calls for creating appropriate data resources and shared experimental protocols. They should target proceeding from segregated classification of signals or natural language to both holistic analyses across data modalities and clinically-meaningful differentiation of disease.",

        "title": "Machine learning based approach for detecting Distributed Denial of Service attack",
        "abstract": "All elements of the IT industry are expanding, including bandwidth, storage, processing speed. As a result, there are now more cyber threats and attacks, necessitating a creative and predictive security approach that employs cutting-edge technology to combat the danger. The trends will be monitored, and adequate analysis from various sets of data will be utilized to build a model that is based on the information available. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most prevalent dangers and attacks wreaking havoc on internet-connected computer equipment. This study compares the performance of several machine learning-based classifiers for detecting DDoS assaults before they occur. This experiment made use of data from the benchmark KDD-Cup-1999 DDoS attack. To choose essential characteristics in the context of DDoS detection, I created three distinct types of feature selection techniques. The findings revealed that feature selection approaches can assist domain specialists in understanding the intrusion system’s hidden key patterns and features during DDoS detection. DNN-based deep learning and semi-supervised learning method were also compared with the ML-based classifiers output. The suggested model learns to recognize regular network traffic to detect ICMP, TCP, and UDP DDoS traffic as it arrives. Experiments show that machine learning algorithms may correctly classify the traffic into regular and DDoS. This discovery has long-term implications in a variety of sectors, including national defence, financial institutions, healthcare, and other businesses where sophisticated intrusion detection techniques are required. In the future, I would want to apply similar approaches to a variety of datasets.",

        "title": "Leveraging distant supervision and deep learning for twitter sentiment and emotion classification",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, various applications across industries, healthcare, and security have begun adopting automatic sentiment analysis and emotion detection in short texts, such as posts from social media. Twitter stands out as one of the most popular online social media platforms due to its easy, unique, and advanced accessibility using the API. On the other hand, supervised learning is the most widely used paradigm for tasks involving sentiment polarity and fine-grained emotion detection in short and informal texts, such as Twitter posts. However, supervised learning models are data-hungry and heavily reliant on abundant labeled data, which remains a challenge. This study aims to address this challenge by creating a large-scale real-world dataset of 17.5 million tweets. A distant supervision approach relying on emojis available in tweets is applied to label tweets corresponding to Ekman’s six basic emotions. Additionally, we conducted a series of experiments using various conventional machine learning models and deep learning, including transformer-based models, on our dataset to establish baseline results. The experimental results and an extensive ablation analysis on the dataset showed that BiLSTM with FastText and an attention mechanism outperforms other models in both classification tasks, achieving an F1-score of 70.92% for sentiment classification and 54.85% for emotion detection.",

        "title": "A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Covid-19 Cases Amongst Suspected Cases and Their Category of Admission",
        "abstract": "The rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide has claimed thousands of lives and has put unprecedented pressure on the healthcare systems around the world. The World Health Organization has emphasised the need for comprehensive testing in order to fight the virus [1]. With the lack of testing kits available worldwide, there is a call for novel testing methods that can help arrest the spread faster [18]. Every health care worker exposed to the virus puts additional pressure on an already outstretched infrastructure. Here, in this study we propose a machine learning approach towards predicting Covid-19 cases among a sample population who have undergone other clinical tests and blood spectrum tests. The patient data used in this effort has been donated by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at São Paulo, Brazil [6] for the purpose of research. The problem at hand is divided into two parts: Predict confirmed COVID-19 cases amongst suspected cases based on the laboratory tests of their clinical samples. Predict admission to general, semi-ICU, and ICU wards among those who predicted positive for COVID-19 in the first task. Our approach uses Classification from Supervised Learning techniques to solve this problem. The efficacy of this approach could be used to scale and develop automated systems that could predict the likeliness of Covid-19 based on laboratory tests that are readily accessible. From the features presented to us in the dataset, we are able to predict with 87.0 - 97.4 percent accuracy at a 95 percent confidence level that a patient is suffering from Covid-19 when biomarkers are taken into consideration. Among those that tested positive, we were able to demonstrate that our model could predict with 87.0 - 100 percent accuracy at a 95 percent confidence that whether the patient would be admitted to a particular ward.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nUnplanned hospital readmissions constitute a significant cost burden in healthcare. Identifying factors contributing to readmission risk presents opportunities for actionable change to reduce readmission rates.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo combine machine learning classification and feature importance analysis to identify drivers of readmission in a large cohort of spine patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCases involving surgical procedures for degenerative spine conditions between 2008 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Of 11 150 cases, 396 patients (3.6%) experienced an unplanned hospital readmission within 30 d of discharge. Over 75 pre-discharge variables were collected and categorized into demographic, perioperative, and resource utilization feature domains. Random forest classification was used to construct predictive models for readmission from feature domains. An ensemble tree-specific method was used to quantify and rank features by relative importance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the demographics domain, age and comorbidity burden were the most important features for readmission prediction. Surgical duration and intraoperative oral morphine equivalents were the most important perioperative features, whereas total direct cost and length of stay were most important in the resource utilization domain. In supervised learning experiments for predicting readmission, the demographic domain model performed the best alone, suggesting that demographic features may contribute more to readmission risk than perioperative variables following spine surgery. A predictive model, created using only enriched features showing substantial importance, demonstrated improved predictive capacity compared to previous models, and approached the performance of state-of-the-art, deep-learning models for readmission.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis strategy provides insight into global patterns of feature importance and better understanding of drivers of readmissions following spine surgery.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computer systems to learn from past experiences and improve accordingly without the direct intervention of the programmer. ML enables machines to behave very similarly to human beings. In order to extract the required information from the huge amount of data, ML can be used to design algorithms based on the trends of data and relationships among the data. ML can be applied in various fields such as intrusion detection, bioinformatics, health care, marketing, game playing, and so on. It enables the computers or the machines to make data-driven decisions rather than being explicitly programmed for carrying out a certain task. These programs or algorithms are designed in a way that they learn and improve over time when they are exposed to new or unseen data. Due to the huge amount of data, the significance of ML can be seen in various sections of the society. Especially in industries, ML is assisting exploration of the hidden patterns of the data, and through this the overall performance of the business can be improved. It is cost-effective, affordable, and simple computing techniques allow the analysis and handling of a huge amount of complex data. ML is not only helping to understand and identify the hidden patterns of a diverse set of data but also encourages automation in analysis in place of humans. Also, ML is helping industries to avail of the opportunities and make it profitable in future endeavors. In this chapter, we first review the fundamental concepts of machine learning such as feature assessment, unsupervised versus supervised learning, and types of classification. Then, details of the ML architecture and framework are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Background: Computer-aided detection of cognitive impairment garnered increasing attention, offering older adults in the community access to more objective, ecologically valid, and convenient cognitive assessments using multimodal sensing technology on digital devices. Methodology: In this study, we aimed to develop an automated method for screening cognitive impairment, building on paper- and electronic TMTs. We proposed a novel deep representation learning approach named Semi-Supervised Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (S2VQ-VAE). Within S2VQ-VAE, we incorporated intra- and inter-class correlation losses to disentangle class-related factors. These factors were then combined with various real-time obtainable features (including demographic, time-related, pressure-related, and jerk-related features) to create a robust feature engineering block. Finally, we identified the light gradient boosting machine as the optimal classifier. The experiments were conducted on a dataset collected from older adults in the community. Results: The experimental results showed that the proposed multi-type feature fusion method outperformed the conventional method used in paper-based TMTs and the existing VAE-based feature extraction in terms of screening performance. Conclusions: In conclusion, the proposed deep representation learning method significantly enhances the cognitive diagnosis capabilities of behavior-based TMTs and streamlines large-scale community-based cognitive impairment screening while reducing the workload of professional healthcare staff.",

        "title": "Parkinson’s Disease Diagnosis Using Machine Learning and Voice",
        "abstract": "Biomarkers derived from human voice can offer in-sight into neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), because of their underlying cognitive and neuromuscular function. PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects about one million people in the the United States, with approximately sixty thousand new clinical diagnoses made each year [1]. Historically, PD has been difficult to quantity and doctors have tended to focus on some symptoms while ignoring others, relying primarily on subjective rating scales [2]. Due to the decrease in motor control that is the hallmark of the disease, voice can be used as a means to detect and diagnose PD. With advancements in technology and the prevalence of audio collecting devices in daily lives, reliable models that can translate this audio data into a diagnostic tool for healthcare professionals would potentially provide diagnoses that are cheaper and more accurate. We provide evidence to validate this concept here using a voice dataset collected from people with and without PD. This paper explores the effectiveness of using supervised classification algorithms, such as deep neural networks, to accurately diagnose individuals with the disease. Our peak accuracy of 85% provided by the machine learning models exceed the average clinical diagnosis accuracy of non-experts (73.8%) and average accuracy of movement disorder specialists (79.6% without follow-up, 83.9% after follow-up) with pathological post-mortem examination as ground truth [3].",

        "abstract": "In the realm of anomaly detection, identifying deviations from normal behavior in data is critical across various applications, including cybersecurity, manufacturing, and healthcare. Traditional supervised methods rely on labeled datasets, which are often scarce or expensive to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose supervised anomaly detection framework that leverages deep learning techniques to extract features from normal semantic patterns. Our approach integrates Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and ResNet-18 architectures to enhance the detection accuracy and efficiency. Initially, CNNs are employed to capture spatial hierarchies in the data, learning robust feature representations from normal samples. The extracted features are then fine-tuned using the ResNet-18 model, known for its depth and skip connections, to ensure comprehensive feature extraction and minimize information loss. Finally, these deep features are fed into an SVM to differentiate between normal and anomalous instances based on the learned semantics. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in detecting anomalies with high precision and recall, outperforming traditional anomaly detection techniques. Our framework's ability to operate without labeled anomalies and adapt to various domains underscores its potential for broad applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\nKeywords— Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and ResNet-18 architectures, deep Learning.",

        "abstract": "Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) require constant and close supervision. To assist clinical staff in this task, hospitals use monitoring systems that trigger audiovisual alarms if their algorithms indicate that a patient's condition may be worsening. However, current monitoring systems are extremely sensitive to movement artefacts and technical errors. As a result, they typically trigger hundreds to thousands of false alarms per patient per day - drowning the important alarms in noise and adding to the exhaustion of clinical staff. In this setting, data is abundantly available, but obtaining trustworthy annotations by experts is laborious and expensive. We frame the problem of false alarm reduction from multivariate time series as a machine-learning task and address it with a novel multitask network architecture that utilises distant supervision through multiple related auxiliary tasks in order to reduce the number of expensive labels required for training. We show that our approach leads to significant improvements over several state-of-the-art baselines on real-world ICU data and provide new insights on the importance of task selection and architectural choices in distantly supervised multitask learning.",

        "abstract": "Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information. \nTo address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are not published, but instead used as \"teachers\" for a \"student\" model. The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy. These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also inspect its internal workings. \nCompared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.",

        "title": "Active Learning for Handling Missing Data",
        "abstract": "Recently, the massive growth of IoT devices and Internet data, which are widely used in many applications, including industry and healthcare, has dramatically increased the amount of free unlabeled data collected. However, this unlabeled data is useless if we want to learn supervised machine learning models. The expensive and time-consuming cost of labeling makes the problem even more challenging. Here, the active learning (AL) technique provides a solution by labeling small but highly informative and representative data, which guarantees a high degree of generalizability over space and improves classification performance with data we have never seen before. The task is more difficult when the active learner has no predefined knowledge, such as initial training data, and when the obtained data is incomplete (i.e., contains missing values). In previous studies, the missing data should first be imputed. Then, the active learner selects from the available unlabeled data, regardless of whether the points were originally observed or imputed. However, selecting inaccurate imputed data points would negatively affect the active learner and prevent it from selecting informative and/or representative points, thus reducing the overall classification performance of the prediction models. This motivated us to introduce a novel query selection strategy that accounts for imputation uncertainty when querying new points. For this purpose, we first introduce a novel multiple imputation method that considers feature importance in selecting the most promising feature groups for missing value estimation. This multiple imputation method provides the ability to quantify the imputation uncertainty of each imputed data point. Furthermore, in each of the two phases of the proposed active learner (exploration and exploitation), imputation uncertainty is taken into account to reduce the probability of selecting points with high imputation uncertainty. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed active learner on different binary and multiclass datasets with different missing rates.",

        "title": "Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms on Surface Enhanced Raman Spectra of Clinical Staphylococcus Species",
        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a widely used analytical technique based on the detection of molecular vibrations in a defined system, which generates Raman spectra that contain unique and highly resolved fingerprints of the system. However, the low intensity of normal Raman scattering effect greatly hinders its application. Recently, the newly emerged surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique overcomes the problem by mixing metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver with samples, which greatly enhances signal intensity of Raman effects by orders of magnitudes when compared with regular RS. In clinical and research laboratories, SERS provides a great potential for fast, sensitive, label-free, and non-destructive microbial detection and identification with the assistance of appropriate machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, choosing an appropriate algorithm for a specific group of bacterial species remains challenging, because with the large volumes of data generated during SERS analysis not all algorithms could achieve a relatively high accuracy. In this study, we compared three unsupervised machine learning methods and 10 supervised machine learning methods, respectively, on 2,752 SERS spectra from 117 Staphylococcus strains belonging to nine clinically important Staphylococcus species in order to test the capacity of different machine learning methods for bacterial rapid differentiation and accurate prediction. According to the results, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) showed the best clustering capacity (Rand index 0.9733) while convolutional neural network (CNN) topped all other supervised machine learning methods as the best model for predicting Staphylococcus species via SERS spectra (ACC 98.21%, AUC 99.93%). Taken together, this study shows that machine learning methods are capable of distinguishing closely related Staphylococcus species and therefore have great application potentials for bacterial pathogen diagnosis in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables label efficient training for machine learning models. This is essential for domains such as medical imaging, where labels are costly and time-consuming to curate. However, the most effective supervised or SSL strategy for transferring models to different healthcare systems or novel tasks is not well understood. In this work, we systematically experiment with a variety of supervised and self-supervised pretraining strategies using multimodal datasets of medical images (chest X-rays) and text (radiology reports). We then evaluate their performance on data from two external institutions with diverse sets of tasks. In addition, we experiment with different transfer learning strategies to effectively adapt these pretrained models to new tasks and healthcare systems. Our empirical results suggest that multimodal SSL gives substantial gains over unimodal SSL in performance across new healthcare systems and tasks, comparable to models pretrained with full supervision. We demonstrate additional performance gains with models further adapted to the new dataset and task, using multimodal domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT), linear probing then finetuning (LP-FT), and both methods combined. We offer suggestions for alternative models to use in scenarios where not all of these additions are feasible. Our results provide guidance for improving the generalization of medical image interpretation models to new healthcare systems and novel tasks.",

        "title": "An active learning enhanced data programming (ActDP) framework for ECG time series",
        "abstract": "\n Supervised machine learning requires the estimation of multiple parameters by using large amounts of labelled data. Getting labelled data generally requires a substantial allocation of resources in terms of both cost and time. In such scenarios, weak supervised learning techniques like data programming (DP) and active learning (AL) can be advantageous for time-series classification tasks. These paradigms can be used to assign data labels in an automated manner, and time-series classification can subsequently be carried out on the labelled data. This work proposes a novel framework titled active learning enhanced data programming (ActDP). It uses DP and AL for ECG classification using single-lead data. ECG classification is pivotal in cardiology and healthcare for diagnosing a broad spectrum of heart conditions and arrhythmias. To establish the usefulness of this proposed ActDP framework, the experiments have been conducted using the MIT-BIH dataset with 94,224 ECG beats. DP assigns a probabilistic label to each ECG beat using nine novel polar labelling functions and a generative model in this work. Further, AL improves the result of DP by replacing the labels for sampled ECG beats of a generative model with ground truth. Subsequently, a discriminative model is trained on these labels for each iteration. The experimental results show that by incorporating AL to DP in the ActDP framework, the accuracy of ECG classification strictly increases from 85.7 % to 97.34 % in 58 iterations. Comparatively, the proposed framework (ActDP) has demonstrated a higher classification accuracy of 97.34 % In contrast, DP with data augmentation (DA) achieves an accuracy of 92.2 %, while DP without DA results in an accuracy of 85.7 %, majority vote yields an accuracy of 50.2 %, and the generative model achieves an accuracy of only 66.5 %.",

        "abstract": "Automated methods for detecting fraudulent healthcare providers have the potential to save billions of dollars in healthcare costs and improve the overall quality of patient care. This study presents a data-centric approach to improve healthcare fraud classification performance and reliability using Medicare claims data. Publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are used to construct nine large-scale labeled data sets for supervised learning. First, we leverage CMS data to curate the 2013–2019 Part B, Part D, and Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Medicare fraud classification data sets. We provide a review of each data set and data preparation techniques to create Medicare data sets for supervised learning and we propose an improved data labeling process. Next, we enrich the original Medicare fraud data sets with up to 58 new provider summary features. Finally, we address a common model evaluation pitfall and propose an adjusted cross-validation technique that mitigates target leakage to provide reliable evaluation results. Each data set is evaluated on the Medicare fraud classification task using extreme gradient boosting and random forest learners, multiple complementary performance metrics, and 95% confidence intervals. Results show that the new enriched data sets consistently outperform the original Medicare data sets that are currently used in related works. Our results encourage the data-centric machine learning workflow and provide a strong foundation for data understanding and preparation techniques for machine learning applications in healthcare fraud.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL), a branch of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is nowadays considered as a core technology of today’s Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0). Due to its learning capabilities from data, DL technology originated from artificial neural network (ANN), has become a hot topic in the context of computing, and is widely applied in various application areas like healthcare, visual recognition, text analytics, cybersecurity, and many more. However, building an appropriate DL model is a challenging task, due to the dynamic nature and variations in real-world problems and data. Moreover, the lack of core understanding turns DL methods into black-box machines that hamper development at the standard level. This article presents a structured and comprehensive view on DL techniques including a taxonomy considering various types of real-world tasks like supervised or unsupervised. In our taxonomy, we take into account deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning, unsupervised or generative learning as well as hybrid learning and relevant others. We also summarize real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be used. Finally, we point out ten potential aspects for future generation DL modeling with research directions. Overall, this article aims to draw a big picture on DL modeling that can be used as a reference guide for both academia and industry professionals.",

        "title": "Electronic Health Records Based Prediction of Future Incidence of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Background Accurate prediction of future incidence of Alzheimer’s disease may facilitate intervention strategy to delay disease onset. Existing AD risk prediction models require collection of biospecimen (genetic, CSF, or blood samples), cognitive testing, or brain imaging. Conversely, EHR provides an opportunity to build a completely automated risk prediction model based on individuals’ history of health and healthcare. We tested machine learning models to predict future incidence of AD using administrative EHR in individuals aged 65 or older. Methods We obtained de-identified EHR from Korean elders age above 65 years old (N=40,736) collected between 2002 and 2010 in the Korean National Health Insurance Service database system. Consisting of Participant Insurance Eligibility database, Healthcare Utilization database, and Health Screening database, our EHR contain 4,894 unique clinical features including ICD-10 codes, medication codes, laboratory values, history of personal and family illness, and socio-demographics. Our event of interest was new incidence of AD defined from the EHR based on both AD codes and prescription of anti-dementia medication. Two definitions were considered: a more stringent one requiring a diagnosis and dementia medication resulting in n=614 cases (“definite AD”) and a more liberal one requiring only diagnostic codes (n=2,026; “probable AD”). We trained and validated a random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression to predict incident AD in 1,2,3, and 4 subsequent years using the EHR available since 2002. The length of the EHR used in the models ranged from 1,571 to 2,239 days. Model training, validation, and testing was done using iterative (5 times), nested, stratified 5-fold cross validation. Results Average duration of EHR was 1,936 days in AD and 2,694 days in controls. For predicting future incidence of AD using the “definite AD” outcome, the machine learning models showed the best performance in 1 year prediction with AUC of 0.781; in 2 year, 0.739; in 3 year, 0.686; in 4 year, 0.662. Using “probable AD” outcome, the machine learning models showed the best performance in 1 year prediction with AUC of 0.730; in 2 year, 0.645; in 3 year, 0.575; in 4 year, 0.602. Important clinical features selected in logistic regression included hemoglobin level (b=-0.902), age (b=0.689), urine protein level (b=0.303), prescription of Lodopin (antipsychotic drug) (b=0.303), and prescription of Nicametate Citrate (vasodilator) (b=-0.297). Conclusion This study demonstrates that EHR can detect risk for incident AD. This approach could enable risk-specific stratification of elders for better targeted clinical trials. Key Points Question Can machine learning be used to predict future incidence of Alzheimer’s disease using electronic health records? Findings We developed and validated supervised machine learning models using the HER data from 40,736 South Korean elders (age above 65 years old). Our model showed acceptable accuracy in predicting up to four year subsequent incidence of AD. Meaning This study shows the potential utility of the administrative EHR data in predicting risk for AD using data-driven machine learning to support physicians at the point of care.",

        "title": "Predicting onset, progression, and clinical subtypes of Parkinson disease using machine learning",
        "abstract": "Background The clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease are characterized by heterogeneity in age at onset, disease duration, rate of progression, and constellation of motor versus nonmotor features. Due to these variable presentations, counseling of patients about their individual risks and prognosis is limited. There is an unmet need for predictive tests that facilitate early detection and characterization of distinct disease subtypes as well as improved, individualized predictions of the disease course. The emergence of machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities to address this critical need. Methods and Findings We used unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches for subtype identification and prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the Parkinson Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) (n=328 cases) to identify patient subtypes and to predict disease progression. The resulting models were validated in an independent, clinically well-characterized cohort from the Parkinson Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) (n=112 cases). Our analysis distinguished three distinct disease subtypes with highly predictable progression rates, corresponding to slow, moderate and fast disease progressors. We achieved highly accurate projections of disease progression four years after initial diagnosis with an average Area Under the Curve of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.96 ± 0.01 for PDvec1, 0.87 ± 0.03 for PDvec2, and 0.96 ± 0.02 for PDvec3). We have demonstrated robust replication of these findings in the independent validation cohort. Conclusions These data-driven results enable clinicians to deconstruct the heterogeneity within their patient cohorts. This knowledge could have immediate implications for clinical trials by improving the detection of significant clinical outcomes that might have been masked by cohort heterogeneity. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, clinical trial design, allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately individualized clinical care.",

        "title": "Machine Learning Algorithm Helps Identify Non-Diagnosed Prodromal Alzheimer’s Disease Patients in the General Population",
        "abstract": "BackgroundRecruiting patients for clinical trials of potential therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a major challenge, with demand for trial participants at an all-time high. The AD treatment R&D pipeline includes around 112 agents. In the United States alone, 150 clinical trials are seeking 70,000 participants. Most people with early cognitive impairment consult primary care providers, who may lack time, diagnostic skills and awareness of local clinical trials. Machine learning and predictive analytics offer promise to boost enrollment by predicting which patients have prodromal AD, and which will go on to develop AD.ObjectivesThe authors set out to develop a machine learning predictive model that identifies prodromal AD patients in the general population, to aid early AD detection by primary care physicians and timely referral to expert sites for biomarker confirmation of diagnosis and clinical trial enrollment.DesignThe authors use a classification machine learning algorithm to extract patterns within healthcare claims and prescription data three years prior to AD diagnosis/AD drug initiation.SettingThe study focused on subjects included within proprietary IQVIA US data assets (claims and prescription databases). Patient information was extracted from January 2010 to July 2018, for cohorts aged between 50 and 85 years.ParticipantsA total of 88,298,289 subjects aged between 50 and 85 years were identified. For the positive cohort, 667,288 subjects were identified who had 24 months of medical history and at least one record with AD or AD treatment. For the negative cohort, 3,670,254 patients were selected who had a similar length of medical history and who were matched to positive cohort subjects based on the prevalence rate. The scoring cohort was selected based on availability of recent medical data of 2–5 years and included 72,670,283 subjects between the ages of 50 and 85 years.Intervention (if any)None.MeasurementsA list of clinically–relevant and interpretable predictors was generated and extracted from the data sets for each subject, including pharmacological treatments (NDC/ product), office/specialist visits (specialty), tests and procedures (HCPCS and CPT), and diagnosis (ICD). The positive cohort was defined as patients who have AD diagnosis/AD treatment with a 3 years offset as an estimate for prodromal AD diagnosis. Supervised ML techniques were used to develop algorithms to predict the occurrence of prodromal AD cases. The sample dataset was divided randomly into a training dataset and a test dataset. The classification models were trained and executed in the PySpark framework. Training and evaluation of LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and GBTClassifier were executed using PySpark’s mllib module. The area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) was used to compare the results of the various models.ResultsThe AUCPRs are 0.426, 0.157, 0.436, and 0.440 for LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and GBTClassifier, respectively, meaning that GBTClassifier (Gradient Boosted Tree) outperforms the other three classifiers. The GBT model identified 222,721 subjects in the prodromal AD stage with 80% precision. Some 76% of identified prodromal AD patients were in the primary care setting.ConclusionsApplying the developed predictive model to 72,670,283 U.S. residents, 222,721 prodromal AD patients were identified, the majority of whom were in the primary care setting. This could drive major advances in AD research by enabling more accurate and earlier prodromal AD diagnosis at the primary care physician level, which would facilitate timely referral to expert sites for in–depth assessment and potential enrolment in clinical trials.",

        "title": "21st century (clinical) decision support in nursing and allied healthcare. Developing a learning health system: a reasoned design of a theoretical framework",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a framework for developing a Learning Health System (LHS) to provide means to a computerized clinical decision support system for allied healthcare and/or nursing professionals. LHSs are well suited to transform healthcare systems in a mission-oriented approach, and is being adopted by an increasing number of countries. Our theoretical framework provides a blueprint for organizing such a transformation with help of evidence based state of the art methodologies and techniques to eventually optimize personalized health and healthcare. Learning via health information technologies using LHS enables users to learn both individually and collectively, and independent of their location. These developments demand healthcare innovations beyond a disease focused orientation since clinical decision making in allied healthcare and nursing is mainly based on aspects of individuals’ functioning, wellbeing and (dis)abilities. Developing LHSs depends heavily on intertwined social and technological innovation, and research and development. Crucial factors may be the transformation of the Internet of Things into the Internet of FAIR data & services. However, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is in up to 80% unstructured including free text narratives and stored in various inaccessible data warehouses. Enabling the use of data as a driver for learning is challenged by interoperability and reusability. To address technical needs, key enabling technologies are suitable to convert relevant health data into machine actionable data and to develop algorithms for computerized decision support. To enable data conversions, existing classification and terminology systems serve as definition providers for natural language processing through (un)supervised learning. To facilitate clinical reasoning and personalized healthcare using LHSs, the development of personomics and functionomics are useful in allied healthcare and nursing. Developing these omics will be determined via text and data mining. This will focus on the relationships between social, psychological, cultural, behavioral and economic determinants, and human functioning. Furthermore, multiparty collaboration is crucial to develop LHSs, and man-machine interaction studies are required to develop a functional design and prototype. During development, validation and maintenance of the LHS continuous attention for challenges like data-drift, ethical, technical and practical implementation difficulties is required.",

        "title": "Diagnosing hospital bacteraemia in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine using electronic health records and machine learning classifiers",
        "abstract": "The bacteraemia prediction is relevant because sepsis is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality. Bacteraemia prognosis primarily depends on a rapid diagnosis. The bacteraemia prediction would shorten up to 6 days the diagnosis, and, in conjunction with individual patient variables, should be considered to start the early administration of personalised antibiotic treatment and medical services, the election of specific diagnostic techniques and the determination of additional treatments, such as surgery, that would prevent subsequent complications. Machine learning techniques could help physicians make these informed decisions by predicting bacteraemia using the data already available in electronic hospital records. This study presents the application of machine learning techniques to these records to predict the blood culture’s outcome, which would reduce the lag in starting a personalised antibiotic treatment and the medical costs associated with erroneous treatments due to conservative assumptions about blood culture outcomes. Six supervised classifiers were created using three machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours, on the electronic health records of hospital patients. The best approach to handle missing data was chosen and, for each machine learning technique, two classification models were created: the first uses the features known at the time of blood extraction, whereas the second uses four extra features revealed during the blood culture. The six classifiers were trained and tested using a dataset of 4357 patients with 117 features per patient. The models obtain predictions that, for the best case, are up to a state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.9%, a sensitivity of 87.4% and an AUC of 0.93. Our results provide cutting-edge metrics of interest in predictive medical models with values that exceed the medical practice threshold and previous results in the literature using classical modelling techniques in specific types of bacteraemia. Additionally, the consistency of results is reasserted because the three classifiers’ importance ranking shows similar features that coincide with those that physicians use in their manual heuristics. Therefore, the efficacy of these machine learning techniques confirms their viability to assist in the aims of predictive and personalised medicine once the disease presents bacteraemia-compatible symptoms and to assist in improving the healthcare economy.",

In addition, generation of high complexity data is common for untargeted metabolomics, requiring careful analysis and interpretation of results. In order to propose an innovative method for the analysis of a mass spectrometry metabolomics dataset, data from a Zika virus study was used. The analysis of this dataset combined principal component analysis and supervised learning methods such as support vector machines and logistic regression, to provide a truthful prediction model for discriminating samples of individuals with Zika virus infection and healthy controls. These supervised methods were used to learn the features that configured the “fingerprint” for the viral infection, showing over 98% of accuracy in a validation set. This model could be used as a fast and reliable test for determining Zika virus infections as part of healthcare services. Furthermore, this novel method shows potential for diagnosing other arboviral diseases.",

        "abstract": "The availability of large scale data with high quality ground truth labels is a challenge when developing supervised machine learning solutions for healthcare domain. Although, the amount of digital data in clinical workflows is increasing, most of this data is distributed on clinical sites and protected to ensure patient privacy. Radiological readings and dealing with large-scale clinical data puts a significant burden on the available resources, and this is where machine learning and artificial intelligence play a pivotal role. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for musculoskeletal (MSK) diagnosis is one example where the scans have a wealth of information, but require a significant amount of time for reading and labeling. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can be a solution for handling the lack of availability of ground truth labels, but generally requires a large amount of training data during the pretraining stage. Herein, we propose a slice-based self-supervised deep learning framework (SB-SSL), a novel slice-based paradigm for classifying abnormality using knee MRI scans. We show that for a limited number of cases (<1000), our proposed framework is capable to identify anterior cruciate ligament tear with an accuracy of 89.17% and an AUC of 0.954, outperforming state-of-the-art without usage of external data during pretraining. This demonstrates that our proposed framework is suited for SSL in the limited data regime.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a chronic disease which poses a serious challenge to human health worldwide. Globally, about 8.3% of the population is diagnosed with the disease. The applications of predictive analytics in diagnosis of diabetes are gaining significant momentum in medical research. The aim of this research paper is to aid medical professionals in the early detection and efficient diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. We utilize bioinformatics theory and supervised machine learning techniques for improving the accuracy in predicting diabetes, based on 8 clinical measurements existing in the widely used PIMA dataset. We outline our methodology and highlight the implementation steps, while reviewing prominent past work in the field. Moreover, this paper fully exploits known machine learning algorithms and provides a detailed comparison of the results obtained from each method. The gradient boosting algorithm with parameter tuning proves to be the most successful, having an F1 Score of 0.853 and out of sample accuracy of 89.94%. Our prediction model focuses on computing the probability of the onset of diabetes in an individual based on their clinical data. The most crucial results of using this research within the healthcare sector are its cost-effectiveness and yielding of instant diagnosis. With this work, we intend to improve the process of diagnosing Type 2 diabetes and inspire other researchers to use machine learning based techniques for further inquiry into diabetes prediction.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is also called gestational diabetes when a woman has high blood sugar while pregnant. It can show up at any time during pregnancy and cause problems for the mother and baby during or after the pregnancy. If the risks are found and dealt with as soon as possible, there is a chance that they can be reduced. The healthcare system is one of the many parts of our daily lives that are being rethought thanks to the creation of intelligent systems by machine learning algorithms. In this article, a hybrid prediction model is suggested to determine if a woman has gestational diabetes. The recommended model reduces the amount of data using the K-means clustering method. Predictions are made using several classification methods, such as decision trees, random forests, SVM, KNN, logistic regression, and naive Bayes. The results show that accuracy increases when clustering and classification are used together.",

        "abstract": "Evaluation of lung mechanics is the primary component for designing lung protective optimal ventilation strategies. This paper presents a machine learning approach for bedside assessment of respiratory resistance (R) and compliance (C). We develop machine learning algorithms to track flow rate and airway pressure and estimate R and C continuously and in real-time. An experimental study is conducted, by connecting a pressure control ventilator to a test lung that simulates various R and C values, to gather sensor data for validation of the devised algorithms. We develop supervised learning algorithms based on decision tree, decision table, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to predict R and C values. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve 90.3%, 93.1%, and 63.9% accuracy in assessing respiratory R and C using decision table, decision tree, and SVM, respectively. These results along with our ability to estimate R and C with 99.4% accuracy using a linear regression model demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for constructing a new generation of ventilation technologies that leverage novel computational models to control their underlying parameters for personalized healthcare and context-aware interventions.",

        "abstract": "The primary focus of technical communication (TC) in the past decade has been the system-assisted generation and utilization of standardized, structured, and classified content for dynamic output solutions. Nowadays, machine learning (ML) approaches offer a new opportunity to integrate unstructured data into existing knowledge bases without the need to manually organize information into topic-based content enriched with semantic metadata. To make the field of artificial intelligence (AI) more accessible for technical writers and content managers, cloud-based machine learning as a service (MLaaS) solutions provide a starting point for domain-specific ML modelling while unloading the modelling process from extensive coding, data processing and storage demands. Therefore, information architects can focus on information extraction tasks and on prospects to include pre-existing knowledge from other systems into the ML modelling process. In this paper, the capability and performance of a cloud-based ML service, IBM Watson, are analysed to assess their value for semantic context analysis. The ML model is based on a supervised learning method and features deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The subject of the analysis is a corpus of scientific publications on the 2019 Coronavirus disease. The analysis focuses on information extractions regarding preventive measures and effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers.",

        "title": "The use of generative artificial intelligence in surgical education: a narrative review",
        "abstract": "The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized healthcare and education. These AI systems, trained on vast datasets using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques and large language models (LLMs), can generate text, images, and videos, offering new avenues for enhancing surgical education. Their ability to produce interactive learning resources, procedural guidance, and feedback post-virtual simulations makes them valuable in educating surgical trainees. However, technical challenges such as data quality issues, inaccuracies, and uncertainties around model interpretability remain barriers to widespread adoption. This review explores the integration of generative AI into surgical training, assessing its potential to enhance learning and teaching methodologies. While generative AI has demonstrated promise for improving surgical education, its integration must be approached cautiously, ensuring AI input is balanced with traditional supervision and mentorship from experienced surgeons. Given that generative AI models are not yet suitable as standalone tools, a blended learning approach that integrates AI capabilities with conventional educational strategies should be adopted. The review also addresses limitations and challenges, emphasizing the need for more robust research on different AI models and their applications across various surgical subspecialties. The lack of standardized frameworks and tools to assess the quality of AI outputs in surgical education necessitates rigorous oversight to ensure accuracy and reliability in training settings. By evaluating the current state of generative AI in surgical education, this narrative review highlights the potential for future innovation and research, encouraging ongoing exploration of AI in enhancing surgical education and training.",

        "abstract": "Identifying intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant patients is essential for the prompt and optimal treatment of Kawasaki disease, suggesting the need for effective risk assessment tools. Data-driven approaches have the potential to identify the high-risk individuals by capturing the complex patterns of real-world data. To enable clinically applicable prediction of intravenous immunoglobulin resistance addressing the incompleteness of clinical data and the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, a multi-stage method is developed by integrating data missing pattern mining and intelligible models. First, co-clustering is adopted to characterize the block-wise data missing patterns by simultaneously grouping the clinical features and patients to enable (a) group-based feature selection and missing data imputation and (b) patient subgroup-specific predictive models considering the availability of data. Second, feature selection is performed using the group Lasso to uncover group-specific risk factors. Third, the Explainable Boosting Machine, which is an interpretable learning method based on generalized additive models, is applied for the prediction of each patient subgroup. The experiments using real-world Electronic Health Records demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework for predictive modeling compared with a set of benchmark methods. This study highlights the integration of co-clustering and supervised learning methods for incomplete clinical data mining, and promotes data-driven approaches to investigate predictors and effective algorithms for decision making in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "ECG classification or heartbeat classification is an extremely valuable tool in cardiology. Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of ECG signals assist human experts in the timely diagnosis of cardiac diseases and help save precious lives. This research aims at digitizing a dataset of images of ECG records into time series signals and then applying deep learning (DL) techniques on the digitized dataset. State-of-the-art DL techniques are proposed for the classification of the ECG signals into different cardiac classes. Multiple DL models, including a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a self-supervised learning (SSL)-based model using autoencoders are explored and compared in this study. The models are trained on the dataset generated from ECG plots of patients from various healthcare institutes in Pakistan. First, the ECG images are digitized, segmenting the lead II heartbeats, and then the digitized signals are passed to the proposed deep learning models for classification. Among the different DL models used in this study, the proposed CNN model achieves the highest accuracy of ∼92%. The proposed model is highly accurate and provides fast inference for real-time and direct monitoring of ECG signals that are captured from the electrodes (sensors) placed on different parts of the body. Using the digitized form of ECG signals instead of images for the classification of cardiac arrhythmia allows cardiologists to utilize DL models directly on ECG signals from an ECG machine for the real-time and accurate monitoring of ECGs.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare workers are constantly exposed to high-stress working conditions that increase burnout rates and lower the quality of patient care. While it is vital to continuously monitor healthcare worker stress to provide necessary interventions, traditional survey methods can interfere with tasks in real-world healthcare contexts. Wearable devices offer a non-invasive way to detect worker stress continuously, however, predictions may be influenced by context-specific activities and stress semantics. Our work assesses generalized stress detection for health workers with currently available datasets using shared stress representations. We tested four machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forest, feed-forward networks, and extreme boosting). We identified extreme boosting as the top-performing model, achieving ROC-AUC scores of up to 0.83 using real-world health worker data. To benchmark generalizability among machine learning stress detection models, we assessed domain adaptation to enhance the transferability of models. Supervised domain adaptation performs comparably to vanilla prediction methods on the target domain. Our work identifies numerous challenges to generalizing stress detection for health workers, including limited shared modalities, small sample sizes, and varying stress definitions. As more data is collected, we must prioritize shared stress representations to enable continuous stress prediction for health workers.",

        "title": "Federated Learning: Attacks and Defenses, Rewards, Energy Efficiency: Past, Present and Future",
        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) was first introduced as an idea by Google in 2016, in which multiple devices jointly train a machine learning model without sharing their data under the supervision of a central server. This offers big opportunities in critical areas like healthcare, industry, and finance, where sharing information with other organizations’ devices is completely prohibited. The combination of Federated Learning with Blockchain technology has led to the so-called Blockchain Federated learning (B.F.L.) which operates in a distributed manner and offers enhanced trust, improved security and privacy, improved traceability and immutability and at the same time enables dataset monetization through tokenization. Unfortunately, vulnerabilities of the blockchain-based solutions have been identified while the implementation of blockchain introduces significant energy consumption issues. There are many solutions that also offer personalized ideas and uses. In the field of security, solutions such as security against model-poisoning backdoor assaults with poles and modified algorithms are proposed. Defense systems that identify hostile devices, Against Phishing and other social engineering attack mechanisms that could threaten current security systems after careful comparison of mutual systems. In a federated learning system built on blockchain, the design of reward mechanisms plays a crucial role in incentivizing active participation. We can use tokens for rewards or other cryptocurrency methods for rewards to a federated learning system. Smart Contracts combined with proof of stake with performance-based rewards or (and) value of data contribution. Some of them use games or game theory-inspired mechanisms with unlimited uses even in other applications like games. All of the above is useless if the energy consumption exceeds the cost of implementing a system. Thus, all of the above is combined with algorithms that make simple or more complex hardware and software adjustments. Heterogeneous data fusion methods, energy consumption models, bandwidth, and controls transmission power try to solve the optimization problems to reduce energy consumption, including communication and compute energy. New technologies such as quantum computing with its advantages such as speed and the ability to solve problems that classical computers cannot solve, their multidimensional nature, analyze large data sets more efficiently than classical artificial intelligence counterparts and the later maturity of a technology that is now expensive will provide solutions in areas such as cryptography, security and why not in energy autonomy. The human brain and an emerging technology can provide solutions to all of the above solutions due to the brain's decentralized nature, built-in reward mechanism, negligible energy use, and really high processing power In this paper we attempt to survey the currently identified threats, attacks and defenses, the rewards and the energy efficiency issues of BFL in order to guide the researchers and the designers of FL based solution to adopt the most appropriate of each application approach.",

        "abstract": "Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning is a type of semi-supervised binary classification where the machine learning algorithm differentiates between a set of positive instances (labeled) and a set of both positive and negative instances (unlabeled). PU learning has broad applications in settings where confirmed negatives are unavailable or difficult to obtain, and there is value in discovering positives among the unlabeled (e.g., viable drugs among untested compounds). Most PU learning algorithms make the selected completely at random (SCAR) assumption, namely that positives are selected independently of their features. However, in many real-world applications, such as healthcare, positives are not SCAR (e.g., severe cases are more likely to be diagnosed), leading to a poor estimate of the proportion, $\\alpha$, of positives among unlabeled examples and poor model calibration, resulting in an uncertain decision threshold for selecting positives. PU learning algorithms can estimate $\\alpha$ or the probability of an individual unlabeled instance being positive or both. We propose two PU learning algorithms to estimate $\\alpha$, calculate calibrated probabilities for PU instances, and improve classification metrics: i) PULSCAR (positive unlabeled learning selected completely at random), and ii) PULSNAR (positive unlabeled learning selected not at random). PULSNAR uses a divide-and-conquer approach that creates and solves several SCAR-like sub-problems using PULSCAR. In our experiments, PULSNAR outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets.",

In the field of medical research, predicting liver tumours represents a daunting task, which calls for the development of a more advanced detection mechanism that is focused towards achieving higher levels of identification precision. Even though experienced medical professionals can make preliminary predictions regarding liver tumours based on their clinical experience and diagnostic tools such as imaging and scans, there is still a compelling need for systematic assistance in making a final decision. This is especially true when evaluating patient symptoms. For the sake of our application, the approach of feature extraction that we have choose to use is called linear discriminant analysis (LDA). LDA displays its usefulness by being able to accommodate classification techniques with more than two classes and by exceeding logistic regression in terms of accuracy of classification. We make use of the power of supervised functions, in particular decision trees and the Naive Bayes algorithm, in order to make an accurate prediction about the existence of liver illness. These algorithms produce predictions regarding the existence of liver disease with a high degree of accuracy by using the factors discovered during LDA analysis. For the purposes of our simulation work, we make use of the flexible scikit-learn library in Python. This library offers a dependable infrastructure for the performance of machine learning activities. The part of this research under “Methodology and Implementation” digs into the specifics of our approach and outlines the actions that are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our prediction model.",

        "title": "Exploration of Machine Learning to Identify Community Dwelling Older Adults with Balance Dysfunction Using Short Duration Accelerometer Data",
        "abstract": "The incidence of fall-related injuries in older adults is high. Given the significant and adverse outcomes that arise from injurious falls in older adults, it is of the utmost importance to identify older adults at greater risk for falls as early as possible. Given that balance dysfunction provides a significant risk factor for falls, an automated and objective identification of balance dysfunction in community dwelling older adults using wearable sensor data when walking may be beneficial. In this study, we examine the feasibility of using wearable sensors, when walking, to identify older adults who have trouble with balance at an early stage using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. We recruited 21 community dwelling older women. The experimental paradigm consisted of two tasks: Normal walking with a self-selected comfortable speed on an instrumented treadmill and a test of reflexive postural response, using the motor control test (MCT). Based on the MCT, identification of older women with low or high balance function was performed. Using short duration accelerometer data from sensors placed on the knee and hip while walking, supervised machine learning was carried out to classify subjects with low and high balance function. Using a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm, we classified balance function in older adults using 60 seconds of accelerometer data with an average cross validation accuracy of 91.5% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.97. Early diagnosis of balance dysfunction in community dwelling older adults through the use of user friendly and inexpensive wearable sensors may help in reducing future fall risk in older adults through earlier interventions and treatments, and thereby significantly reduce associated healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "Objectives : This study is aimed at developing and discussing the prediction model of blood stasis pattern of traditional Korean medicine(TKM) using machine learning algorithms: multiple logistic regression and decision tree model. Methods : First, we reviewed the blood stasis(BS) questionnaires of Korean, Chinese, and Japanese version to make a integrated BS questionnaire of patient-reported outcomes. Through a human subject research, patients-reported BS symptoms data were acquired. Next, experts decisions of 5 Korean medicine doctor were also acquired, and supervised learning models were developed using multiple logistic regression and decision tree. Results : Integrated BS questionnaire with 24 items was developed. Multiple logistic regression models with accuracy of 0.92(male) and 0.95(female) validated by 10-folds cross-validation were constructed. By decision tree modeling methods, male model with 8 decision node and female model with 6 decision node were made. In the both models, symptoms of ‘recent physical trauma’, ‘chest pain’, ‘numbness’, and ‘menstrual disorder(female only)’ were considered as important factors. Conclusions : Because machine learning, especially supervised learning, can reveal and suggest important or essential factors among the very various symptoms making up a pattern identification, it can be a very useful tool in researching diagnostics of TKM. With a proper patient-reported outcomes or well-structured database, it can also be applied to a pre-screening solutions of healthcare system in Mibyoung stage.",

        "title": "Prototype vector machine for large scale semi-supervised learning",
        "abstract": "Practical data mining rarely falls exactly into the supervised learning scenario. Rather, the growing amount of unlabeled data poses a big challenge to large-scale semi-supervised learning (SSL). We note that the computational intensiveness of graph-based SSL arises largely from the manifold or graph regularization, which in turn lead to large models that are difficult to handle. To alleviate this, we proposed the prototype vector machine (PVM), a highly scalable, graph-based algorithm for large-scale SSL. Our key innovation is the use of \"prototypes vectors\" for efficient approximation on both the graph-based regularizer and model representation. The choice of prototypes are grounded upon two important criteria: they not only perform effective low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix, but also span a model suffering the minimum information loss compared with the complete model. We demonstrate encouraging performance and appealing scaling properties of the PVM on a number of machine learning benchmark data sets.",

        "title": "Uncertainty Estimation with Data Augmentation for Active Learning Tasks on Health Data",
        "abstract": "Supervised machine learning (ML) is revolutionising healthcare, but the acquisition of reliable labels for signals harvested from medical sensors is usually challenging, manual, and costly. Active learning can assist in establishing labels on-the-fly by querying the user only for the most uncertain –and thus informative– samples. However, current approaches rely on naive data selection algorithms, which still require many iterations to achieve the desired accuracy. To this aim, we introduce a novel framework that exploits data augmentation for estimating the uncertainty introduced by sensor signals.Our experiments on classifying medical signals show that our framework selects informative samples up to 50% more diverse. Sample diversity is a key indicator of uncertainty, and our framework can capture this diversity better than previous solutions as it picks unlabelled samples with a higher average point distance during the first queries compared to the baselines, which pick samples that are closer together. Through our experiments, we show that augmentation-based uncertainty makes better decisions, as the more informative signals are labelled first and the learner is able to train on samples with more diverse features earlier on, thus enabling the potential expansion of ML in more real-life healthcare use cases.",

        "abstract": "Fraud, waste, and abuse are spreading throughout the healthcare industry and costing patients and taxpayers billions of dollars. Fortunately, electronic medical records and publicly available data sources like the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have enabled data mining and machine learning techniques that can help automate the detection of healthcare fraud. In this study, we explore the application of healthcare provider summary data for the purpose of fraud detection. We leverage the latest CMS Part B Summary by Provider big data sets to curate two new labeled data sets for supervised learning. The two new data sets are compared to a popular baseline data set from related works using six runs of cross validation with two popular ensemble learners, multiple complementary performance metrics, and statistical tests. Classification results show that the proposed provider summary features are good indicators of healthcare fraud. A two-way analysis of variance test and 95% confidence intervals show that the new features yield significantly better performance on the fraud detection task when used to enrich existing data sets. Finally, feature contributions are measured with Shapley values to illustrate the top 20 features that contribute to fraud estimation.",

        "title": "An IoT-based wearable system using accelerometers and machine learning for fetal movement monitoring",
        "abstract": "Fetal movement is an essential index of fetal well-being. However, existing technologies in clinical applications cannot provide an effective, long-term and easily accessible way for fetal movement monitoring. This paper presents a wearable system using accelerometers and machine learning for automatic monitoring of fetal movement. To realize the concept of the e-health home care, Internet of Things (IoT) is applied on the system to connect all the terminal monitoring units to a control center. The whole system mainly consists of two parts: the local monitoring unit and the remote health evaluation unit, respectively. The local monitoring unit includes: (1) a garment integrating accelerometers for data acquisition and an embedded system for signal processing and machine learning, (2) an Android-based local monitoring platform used for visualization of statistics on fetal health status based on information received from the garment via Bluetooth. The local monitoring unit is also designed to alarm the mother if fetal movements reduce significantly or if the intensity is weakened. The remote health evaluation unit consists of a cloud computing platform and an expert system. Connecting each terminal local monitoring unit via the Internet, the remote health evaluation unit allows an expert to access the information at distance for further medical supervision, make advanced diagnosis as well as take actions in case of emergency. The cloud computing platform is also designed for convergence of medical data from each individual patient to build a general medical database for scientific research. The proposed local fetal movement monitoring unit along with the remote health evaluation platform could be regarded as a good example of IoT application in the field of smart textile and home healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 962,000,000 persons worldwide are 60 or older. Despite the widespread adoption of techniques for human activity detection, there has been a dearth of study into the specific challenge of identifying the tasks performed by the elderly. Given the proliferation of wearable and mobile devices, the Internet of Healthcare Things is assuming a larger role in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). This article focuses on assisting the elderly by tracking their movements in both indoor and outdoor settings. The dataset includes human actions like sitting, walking, ascending and descending stairs, standing, and lying down. Here, how deep learning might improve HAR in Internet of Home Things settings has been examined. For better HAR results, a semi-supervised deep learning framework has been developed that makes effective use of the imperfectly labelled sensor data in order to fine-tune the classifier learning model. An intelligent auto-labelling system is built on top of Deep Q-Network to enhance learning performance in Internet of Things (IoT) environment and address the issue of insufficient labelled samples. Finally, real-world data is used in trial and evaluation to prove the method’s utility and efficacy.",

        "title": "Self-Supervised Transformer for Sparse and Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Clinical Time-Series",
        "abstract": "Multivariate time-series data are frequently observed in critical care settings and are typically characterized by sparsity (missing information) and irregular time intervals. Existing approaches for learning representations in this domain handle these challenges by either aggregation or imputation of values, which in-turn suppresses the fine-grained information and adds undesirable noise/overhead into the machine learning model. To tackle this problem, we propose a Self-supervised Transformer for Time-Series (STraTS) model, which overcomes these pitfalls by treating time-series as a set of observation triplets instead of using the standard dense matrix representation. It employs a novel Continuous Value Embedding technique to encode continuous time and variable values without the need for discretization. It is composed of a Transformer component with multi-head attention layers, which enable it to learn contextual triplet embeddings while avoiding the problems of recurrence and vanishing gradients that occur in recurrent architectures. In addition, to tackle the problem of limited availability of labeled data (which is typically observed in many healthcare applications), STraTS utilizes self-supervision by leveraging unlabeled data to learn better representations by using time-series forecasting as an auxiliary proxy task. Experiments on real-world multivariate clinical time-series benchmark datasets demonstrate that STraTS has better prediction performance than state-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction, especially when labeled data is limited. Finally, we also present an interpretable version of STraTS, which can identify important measurements in the time-series data. Our data preprocessing and model implementation codes are available at https://github.com/sindhura97/STraTS.",

        "title": "Machine Learning for the New York City Power Grid",
        "abstract": "Power companies can benefit from the use of knowledge discovery methods and statistical machine learning for preventive maintenance. We introduce a general process for transforming historical electrical grid data into models that aim to predict the risk of failures for components and systems. These models can be used directly by power companies to assist with prioritization of maintenance and repair work. Specialized versions of this process are used to produce (1) feeder failure rankings, (2) cable, joint, terminator, and transformer rankings, (3) feeder Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) estimates, and (4) manhole events vulnerability rankings. The process in its most general form can handle diverse, noisy, sources that are historical (static), semi-real-time, or real-time, incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for prioritization (supervised ranking or MTBF), and includes an evaluation of results via cross-validation and blind test. Above and beyond the ranked lists and MTBF estimates are business management interfaces that allow the prediction capability to be integrated directly into corporate planning and decision support; such interfaces rely on several important properties of our general modeling approach: that machine learning features are meaningful to domain experts, that the processing of data is transparent, and that prediction results are accurate enough to support sound decision making. We discuss the challenges in working with historical electrical grid data that were not designed for predictive purposes. The “rawness” of these data contrasts with the accuracy of the statistical models that can be obtained from the process; these models are sufficiently accurate to assist in maintaining New York City's electrical grid.",

        "abstract": "Adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting is a major component of drug safety monitoring; its input will, however, only be optimized if systems can manage to deal with its tremendous flow of information, based primarily on unstructured text fields. The aim of this study was to develop an automated system allowing to code ADRs from patient reports. Our system was based on a knowledge base about drugs, enriched by supervised machine learning (ML) models trained on patients reporting data. To train our models, we selected all cases of ADRs reported by patients to a French Pharmacovigilance Centre through a national web‐portal between March 2017 and March 2019 (n = 2,058 reports). We tested both conventional ML models and deep‐learning models. We performed an external validation using a dataset constituted of a random sample of ADRs reported to the Marseille Pharmacovigilance Centre over the same period (n = 187). Here, we show that regarding area under the curve (AUC) and F‐measure, the best model to identify ADRs was gradient boosting trees (LGBM), with an AUC of 0.93 (0.92–0.94) and F‐measure of 0.72 (0.68–0.75). This model was run for external validation showing an AUC of 0.91 and a F‐measure of 0.58. We evaluated an artificial intelligence pipeline that was found able to learn how to identify correctly ADRs from unstructured data. This result allowed us to start a new study using more data to further improve our performance and offer a tool that is useful in practice to efficiently manage drug safety information.",

        "title": "Study design: Development of an advanced machine learning algorithm for the early diagnosis of Gaucher disease using real-world data",
        "abstract": "Background: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare, autosomal recessive condition, characterized by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase. The main disease features are anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepato-splenomegaly and bone infarction, osteonecrosis, and pathological fractures. However, diagnosis of GD can be challenging, especially for non-specialists, owing to wide variability in age at presentation, non-specific features, severity and type of clinical manifestations, and lack of awareness of the early signs and symptoms of the disease. Delayed and misdiagnosis of GD may lead to irreversible bone disease, severe growth retardation, and high risk of bleeding; in rare cases, misdiagnosis may be life-threatening. Developing a system for early and accurate diagnosis of GD is thus an essential unmet need. The development of an algorithm for early diagnosis of patients with rare diseases such as GD may help reduce delays in diagnosis and enable prompt, appropriate initiation of therapy, earlier decision-making, prevent potentially irreversible morbidities and unnecessary tests (some invasive), reduce anxiety, and facilitate genetic counseling. This study aims to develop a predictive model for the accurate diagnosis of GD using machine learning based on real-world clinical data.\n Methods: This study will be comprised of three parts. Part 1, a retrospective observational database analysis, will use data from the electronic patient database of the Maccabi Healthcare Service (MHS), the second largest Health Maintenance Organization in Israel. The MHS includes 2.2 million health records from 25% of the Israeli population. Clinical records have been fully computerized for >20 years and are fully integrated with automated central laboratory, digitized imaging and pharmacy purchase data. Patients with confirmed GD who have been enrolled in the MHS health plan for ≥1 year will be eligible for inclusion, with approximately 250 patients with GD expected to be enrolled. Using MHS data from patients with GD, the Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus (GED-C) scoring system, developed by a consensus panel using Delphi methodology on the signs and co-variables that may be important for the diagnosis of GD, will be evaluated and compared with alternative scores developed directly from clinical data based on supervised machine learning.\n In Part 2, a clinical study, the best performing modeled scores from Part 1 will be applied to the MHS database to identify individuals who may have undiagnosed GD ('GD suspects'). Samples for diagnostic testing (using a specific and sensitive biomarker (glucosylsphingosine, lyso-Gb1) followed by beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) genotyping for positive samples) will be collected from MHS biobank (for individuals who have consented). Individuals not participating in the biobank will be asked to provide a sample. This part of the study will evaluate the predictive value of the modeled scores, and assess the sensitivity and specificity of the model for the diagnosis of new patients with GD.\n In Part 3, analysis of data from newly diagnosed patients identified in Part 2 will be used to develop machine learning models for the diagnosis of GD (Figure 1). Signs and co-variables included in the GED-C score will be used, eliminating features that are non-informative. Features will be quantitative where possible, and interaction terms will be added for age of onset and trend for key features. A number of methods will be developed, with the best performing, based on its precision at a given sensitivity level, being selected as the final model. External validation of the best identified model is planned, to ensure unbiased estimate of the model's accuracy.\n Discussion: The main goal of the study is to develop an algorithm to help detect patients with GD, independent of physicians' ability to recognize signs and symptoms, using the application of machine learning to data from a large health database. The study is expected to result in a practical tool that will alert physicians to the possibility of GD. The resulting model will also improve our understanding of GD based on the relative importance of features for GD prediction. Such tools will have a positive impact on patient care and quality of life and on healthcare costs and may lead to a change in approach for diagnosing rare diseases.\n \n \n \n Revel-Vilk: Takeda: Honoraria; sanofi-Genzyme: Honoraria; Pfizer: Honoraria.

        "title": "Classification of COVID-19 from tuberculosis and pneumonia using deep learning techniques",
        "abstract": "Deep learning provides the healthcare industry with the ability to analyse data at exceptional speeds without compromising on accuracy. These techniques are applicable to healthcare domain for accurate and timely prediction. Convolutional neural network is a class of deep learning methods which has become dominant in various computer vision tasks and is attracting interest across a variety of domains, including radiology. Lung diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), bacterial and viral pneumonias, and COVID-19 are not predicted accurately due to availability of very few samples for either of the lung diseases. The disease could be easily diagnosed using X-ray or CT scan images. But the number of images available for each of the disease is not as equally as other resulting in imbalance nature of input data. Conventional supervised machine learning methods do not achieve higher accuracy when trained using a lesser amount of COVID-19 data samples. Image data augmentation is a technique that can be used to artificially expand the size of a training dataset by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. Data augmentation helped reduce overfitting when training a deep neural network. The SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) algorithm is used for the purpose of balancing the classes. The novelty in this research work is to apply combined data augmentation and class balance techniques before classification of tuberculosis, pneumonia, and COVID-19. The classification accuracy obtained with the proposed multi-level classification after training the model is recorded as 97.4% for TB and pneumonia and 88% for bacterial, viral, and COVID-19 classifications. The proposed multi-level classification method produced is ~8 to ~10% improvement in classification accuracy when compared with the existing methods in this area of research. The results reveal the fact that the proposed system is scalable to growing medical data and classifies lung diseases and its sub-types in less time with higher accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Creation of realistic synthetic behavior-based sensor data is an important aspect of testing machine learning techniques for healthcare applications. Many of the existing approaches for generating synthetic data are often limited in terms of complexity and realism. We introduce SynSys, a machine learning-based synthetic data generation method, to improve upon these limitations. We use this method to generate synthetic time series data that is composed of nested sequences using hidden Markov models and regression models which are initially trained on real datasets. We test our synthetic data generation technique on a real annotated smart home dataset. We use time series distance measures as a baseline to determine how realistic the generated data is compared to real data and demonstrate that SynSys produces more realistic data in terms of distance compared to random data generation, data from another home, and data from another time period. Finally, we apply our synthetic data generation technique to the problem of generating data when only a small amount of ground truth data is available. Using semi-supervised learning we demonstrate that SynSys is able to improve activity recognition accuracy compared to using the small amount of real data alone.",

        "abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are recent innovative approaches in distance education, which provide learning content to participants without age‐, gender‐, race‐, or geography‐related barriers. The purpose of our research is to present an efficient sentiment classification scheme with high predictive performance in MOOC reviews, by pursuing the paradigms of ensemble learning and deep learning. In this contribution, we seek to answer several research questions on sentiment analysis on educational data. First, the predictive performance of conventional supervised learning methods, ensemble learning methods and deep learning methods has been evaluated. Besides, the efficiency of text representation schemes and word‐embedding schemes has been evaluated for sentiment analysis on MOOC evaluations. For the evaluation task, we have analyzed a corpus containing 66,000 MOOC reviews, with the use of machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning methods. The empirical analysis indicate that deep learning‐based architectures outperform ensemble learning methods and supervised learning methods for the task of sentiment analysis on educational data mining. For all the compared configurations, the highest predictive performance has been achieved by long short‐term memory networks in conjunction with GloVe word‐embedding scheme‐based representation, with a classification accuracy of 95.80%.",

        "title": "Detection of Breast Cancer Through Clinical Data Using Supervised and Unsupervised Feature Selection Techniques",
        "abstract": "Breast cancer is one the most critical disease and suffered many people around the world. The efficient and correct detection of breast cancer is still needed to ensure this medical issue although the researchers around the world are proposed different diagnostic methods for detection of this disease, however these existing methods still needed further improvement to correct and efficient detection of this disease. In this study, we proposed a new breast cancer identification method by using machine learning algorithms and clinical data. In the proposed method supervised (Relief algorithm) and unsupervised (Autoencoder, PCA algorithms) techniques have been used for related features selection from data set and then these selected features have been used for training and testing of classifier support vector machine for accurate and on time detection of breast cancer. Additionally, in the proposed approach k fold cross validation method has been used for model validation and best hyperparameters selection. The model performance evaluation metrics have been used for model performance evaluation. The BC data sets have been used for testing of the proposed method. The analysis of experimental results has been demonstrated that the features selected by Relief algorithm are more related for accurate detection of Breast cancer instead of features selected by Auotencoder and PCA algorithms. The proposed method has been attained high results in terms of accuracy on selected feature selected by Relief algorithm and achieved 99.91% accuracy. We have been employed McNemar’s statistical test for performance comparison of our different models. Further, the proposed method performance has been compared with baseline methods in the literature and the proposed method performance is high as compared to base line methods. Due to the high performance of the proposed method (Relief-Support vector machine) we highly recommended it for the diagnosis of breast cancer. In addition, the proposed method can be easily incorporated into the healthcare system for reliable diagnosis of Breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) is a geometrically motivated framework for machine learning within which several semi-supervised algorithms have been constructed. Here we try to provide some theoretical understanding of this approach. Our main result is to expose the natural structure of a class of problems on which manifold regularization methods are helpful. We show that for such problems, no supervised learner can learn effectively. On the other hand, a manifold based learner (that knows the manifold or \"learns\" it from unlabeled examples) can learn with relatively few labeled examples. Our analysis follows a minimax style with an emphasis on finite sample results (in terms of n: the number of labeled examples). These results allow us to properly interpret manifold regularization and related spectral and geometric algorithms in terms of their potential use in semi-supervised learning.",

        "title": "Decision Support System in Healthcare for Predicting Blood Pressure Disorders",
        "abstract": "Blood pressure problems including hypertension and hypotension are considered common among the elderly population, especially hypertension. Recently it started being common among younger adults due to many factors related to unhealthy lifestyles, stress, or genetic factors. Besides the fact of considering hypertension as a chronic disease, it is also considered a primary or contributing cause of complicated risky health issues such as strokes, heart diseases, and chronic kidney failure. In many cases, hypertensive patients may not be aware of their problem because they don't experience any symptoms or warning signs. For this reason, it is essential to build a decision support system to identify individuals at high risk of blood pressure problems including raised blood pressure and low blood pressure. This paper proposes a decision support model for predicting blood pressure disorders by using input variables such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol level, heart rate, and glucose level. The decision model helps in early warning of the potential risk of hypertension or hypotension. As a result, people under potential risk are advised to measure their blood pressure regularly and take the needed precautions or medications to avoid or control this health issue. The proposed decision support model is based on using supervised machine learning classification algorithms, mainly Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. The experimental results show that the model achieved the best performance when implemented using a Random Forest classifier with a 10-fold cross-validation method, with an accuracy of 85.81%.",

        "title": "Machine learning approaches and web-based system to the application of disease modifying therapy for sickle cell",
        "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common serious genetic disease, which has a severe impact due to red blood cell (RBCs) abnormality. According to the World Health Organisation, 7 million newborn babies each year suffer either from the congenital anomaly or from an inherited disease, primarily from thalassemia and sickle cell disease. In the case of SCD, recent research has shown the beneficial effects of a drug called hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide in modifying the disease phenotype. The clinical management of this disease-modifying therapy is difficult and time consuming for clinical staff. This includes finding an optimal classifier that can help to solve the issues with missing values, multi-class datasets, and features selection. For the classification and discriminant analysis of SCD datasets, 7 classifiers based on machine learning models are selected representing linear and non-linear methods. After running these classifiers with a single model, the results revealed that a single classifier has provided us with effective outcomes in terms of the classification performance evaluation metric. In order to produce such an optimal outcome, this research proposed and designed combined classifiers (ensemble classifiers) among the neural network’s models, the random forest classifier, and the K-nearest neighbour classifier. In this aspect, combining the levenberg-marquardt algorithm, the voted perceptron classifier, the radial basis neural classifier, and random forest classifier obtain the highest rate of performance and accuracy. This ensemble classifier receives better results during the training set and testing set process. Recent technology advances based on smart devices have improved the medical facilities and become increasingly popular in association with real-time health monitoring and remote/personal health-care. The web-based system developed under the supervision of the haematology specialist at the Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in order to produce such an effective and useful system for both patients and clinicians. To sum up, the simulation experiment concludes that using machine learning and the web-based system platforms represents an alternative procedure that could assist healthcare professionals, particularly for the specialist nurse and junior doctor to improve the quality of care with sickle cell disorder.",

The efficiency of each classification method has been compared to a reference method that combines a large number of biophysical features referred to as PolySomnoGraphy (PSG). Five classical machine learning methods were evaluated by testing their accuracy on the same collected data. Finally, using a neural network with a short memory method, the classification task fitted 91.34% of the PSG classification.",

        "abstract": "There is a well-established tradition within the statistics literature that explores different techniques for reducing the dimensionality of large feature spaces. The problem is central to machine learning and it has been largely explored under the unsupervised learning paradigm. We introduce a supervised clustering methodology that capitalizes on a Metropolis Hastings algorithm to optimize the partition structure of a large categorical feature space tailored towards minimizing the test error of a learning algorithm. This is a general methodology that can be applied to any supervised learning problem with a large categorical feature space. We show the benefits of the algorithm by applying this methodology to the problem of risk adjustment in competitive health insurance markets. We use a large claims data set that records ICD-10 codes, a large categorical feature space. We aim at improving risk adjustment by clustering diagnostic codes into risk groups suitable for health expenditure prediction. We test the performance of our methodology against common alternatives using panel data from a representative sample of twenty three million citizens in Colombian Healthcare System. Our results outperform common alternatives and suggest that it has potential to improve risk adjustment.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents ssLOTR (self-supervised learning on the rings), a system that shows the feasibility of designing self-supervised learning based techniques for 3D finger motion tracking using a custom-designed wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor with a minimal overhead of labeled training data. Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of applications in augmented and virtual reality, sign language recognition, rehabilitation healthcare, sports analytics, etc. However, unlike vision, there are no large-scale training datasets for developing robust machine learning (ML) models on wearable devices. ssLOTR designs ML models based on data augmentation and self-supervised learning to first extract efficient representations from raw IMU data without the need for any training labels. The extracted representations are further trained with small-scale labeled training data. In comparison to fully supervised learning, we show that only 15% of labeled training data is sufficient with self-supervised learning to achieve similar accuracy. Our sensor device is designed using a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB) to minimize the footprint and uses a combination of Polylactic acid (PLA) and Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as housing materials for sturdiness and flexibility. It incorporates a system-on-chip (SoC) microcontroller with integrated WiFi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules for real-time wireless communication, portability, and ubiquity. In contrast to gloves, our device is worn like rings on fingers, and therefore, does not impede dexterous finger motion. Extensive evaluation with 12 users depicts a 3D joint angle tracking accuracy of 9.07° (joint position accuracy of 6.55mm) with robustness to natural variation in sensor positions, wrist motion, etc, with low overhead in latency and power consumption on embedded platforms.",

        "abstract": "An increasing and aging patient population poses a growing burden on healthcare professionals. Automation of medical imaging diagnostics holds promise for enhancing patient care and reducing manpower required to accommodate an increasing patient-population. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has the potential to facilitate automated diagnostics, but commonly requires large-scaled labeled datasets. In medical domains, data is often abundant but labeling is a laborious and costly task. Active learning provides a method to optimize the selection of unlabeled samples that are most suitable for improvement of the model and incorporate them into the model training process. This approach proves beneficial when only a small number of labeled samples are available. Various selection methods currently exist, but most of them employ fixed querying schedules. There is limited research on how the timing of a query can impact performance in relation to the number of queried samples. This paper proposes a novel approach called dynamic querying, which aims to optimize the timing of queries to enhance model development while utilizing as few labeled images as possible. The performance of the proposed model is compared to a model trained utilizing a fully-supervised training method, and its effectiveness is assessed based on dataset size requirements and loss rates. Dynamic querying demonstrates a considerably faster learning curve in relation to the number of labeled samples used, achieving an accuracy of 70% using only 24 samples, compared to 82% for a fully-supervised model trained on the complete training dataset of 1017 images.",

        "title": "BIOCAD: Bio-Inspired Optimization for Classification and Anomaly Detection in Digital Healthcare Systems",
        "abstract": "The modern smart digital healthcare system (SDHS) is leaning towards automation of patient disease monitoring and treatment with the advent of wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) and the internet of medical things (IoMT). However, the open communication network for sensitive medical data transfer is giving rise to vulnerabilities and security concerns. To prevent adversarial manipulation of sensor measurements, SDHS IoMT controllers leverage anomaly detection systems on top of the disease classification systems. Machine learning (ML) is one of the most effective techniques for providing experience-based automated decision-making models. These models generalize well to produce the expected output for the unseen inputs from the learned patterns. Therefore, ML-based models are currently being adopted to automate the anomaly detection and disease classification tasks of SDHS. In this work, we consider a SDHS that uses supervised ML models for patient status/disease classification and unsupervised ML models for anomaly detection. However, the performance of the ML models largely depends on hyper-parameter tuning. Finding the optimal hyper-parameter is a challenging task, and it becomes more difficult and time-consuming in high-dimensional feature space. In this work, we propose BIOCAD, a comprehensive bio-inspired optimization framework for SDHS data classification and anomaly detection. The framework leverages a novel fitness function for unsu-pervised anomaly detection ML models. We experiment with state-of-the-art datasets - the Pima Indians diabetes dataset, the Parkinson dataset, and the University of Queensland vital signs (UQVS) dataset for validating our proposed strategy.",

        "title": "Explainable Neural Rule Learning",
        "abstract": "Although neural networks have achieved great successes in various machine learning tasks, people can hardly know what neural networks learn from data due to their black-box nature. The lack of such explainability is one of the limitations of neural networks when applied in domains, e.g., healthcare and finance, that demand transparency and accountability. Moreover, explainability is beneficial for guiding a neural network to learn the causal patterns that can extrapolate out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which is critical in real-world applications and has surged as a hot research topic. In order to improve the explainability of neural networks, we propose a novel method—Explainable Neural Rule Learning (denoted as ENRL), with the aim to integrate the expressiveness of neural networks and the explainability of rule-based systems. Specifically, we first design several operator modules and guide them to behave as certain relational operators via self-supervised learning. With input feature fields and learnable context values serving as arguments, these operator modules are used as predicates to constitute the atomic propositions. Then we employ neural logical operations to combine atomic propositions into a collection of rules. Finally, we design a voting mechanism for these rules so that they collaboratively make up our predictive model. Thus, rule learning is transformed to neural architecture search, that is, to choose the appropriate arrangements of feature fields and operator modules. After searching for a specific architecture and learning the involved modules, the resulting neural network explicitly expresses some rules and thus possesses explainability. Therefore, we can predict for each input instance according to rules it satisfies, which at the same time explains how the neural network makes that decision. We conduct a series of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate ENRL. Compared with conventional neural networks, ENRL achieves competitive in-distribution performance while providing the extra benefits of explainability. Meanwhile, ENRL significantly alleviates performance drop on OOD test data, implying the effectiveness of rule learning. Codes are provided at https://github.com/Shuriken13/ENRL.",

        "abstract": "Medical imaging is becoming indispensable for patients' healthcare. Machine learning plays an essential role in the medical imaging field, including computer-aided diagnosis, image segmentation, image registration, image fusion, image-guided therapy, image annotation, and image database retrieval. With advances in medical imaging, new imaging modalities and methodologies such as cone-beam/multislice CT, 3D ultrasound imaging, tomosynthesis, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron-emission tomography (PET)/CT, electrical impedance tomography, and diffuse optical tomography, new machine-learning algorithms/applications are demanded in the medical imaging field. Because of large variations and complexityit is generally difficult to derive analytic solutions or simple equations to represent objects such as lesions and anatomy in medical images. Therefore, tasks in medical imaging require “learning from examples” for accurate representation of data and prior knowledge. Because of its essential needs, machine learning in medical imaging is one of the most promising, growing fields. \n \nThe main aim of this special issue is to help advance the scientific research within the broad field of machine learning in medical imaging. The special issue was planned in conjunction with the International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2010) [1], which was the first workshop on this topic, held at the 13th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2010) in September, 2010, in Beijing, China. This special issue is one in a series of special issues of journals on this topic [2]; it focuses on major trends and challenges in this area, and it presents work aimed at identifying new cutting-edge techniques and their use in medical imaging. \n \nThe quality level of the submissions for this special issue was very high. A total of 17 papers were submitted to this issue in response to the call for papers. Based on a rigorous review process, 10 papers (59%) were accepted for publication in the special issue. The special issue starts by a review of studies on a class of machine-learning techniques, called pixel/voxel-based machine learning, in medical imaging by K. Suzuki. A series of medical imaging applications of machine-learning techniques are presented. A large variety of applications are well represented here, including organ modeling by D. Wang et al. and X. Qiao and Y.-W. Chen, brain function estimation by V. Michel et al., image reconstruction by H. Shouno et al., lesion classification by P. Wighton et al., modality classification by X.-H. Han and Y.-W. Chen, lesion segmentation by M. Zortea et al., organ segmentation by S. Alzubi et al., and visualization of molecular signals by F. Mattoli et al.

        "title": "Fault Detection Effectiveness of Metamorphic Relations Developed for Testing Supervised Classifiers",
        "abstract": "In machine learning, supervised classifiers are used to obtain predictions for unlabeled data by inferring prediction functions using labeled data. Supervised classifiers are widely applied in domains such as computational biology, computational physics and healthcare to make critical decisions. However, it is often hard to test supervised classifiers since the expected answers are unknown. This is commonly known as the oracle problem and metamorphic testing (MT) has been used to test such programs. In MT, metamorphic relations (MRs) are developed from intrinsic characteristics of the software under test (SUT). These MRs are used to generate test data and to verify the correctness of the test results without the presence of a test oracle. Effectiveness of MT heavily depends on the MRs used for testing. In this paper we have conducted an extensive empirical study to evaluate the fault detection effectiveness of MRs that have been used in multiple previous studies to test supervised classifiers. Our study uses a total of 709 reachable mutants generated by multiple mutation engines and uses data sets with varying characteristics to test the SUT. Our results reveal that only 14.8% of these mutants are detected using the MRs and that the fault detection effectiveness of these MRs do not scale with the increased number of mutants when compared to what was reported in previous studies.",

        "abstract": "We present a new machine learning framework called \"self-taught learning\" for using unlabeled data in supervised classification tasks. We do not assume that the unlabeled data follows the same class labels or generative distribution as the labeled data. Thus, we would like to use a large number of unlabeled images (or audio samples, or text documents) randomly downloaded from the Internet to improve performance on a given image (or audio, or text) classification task. Such unlabeled data is significantly easier to obtain than in typical semi-supervised or transfer learning settings, making self-taught learning widely applicable to many practical learning problems. We describe an approach to self-taught learning that uses sparse coding to construct higher-level features using the unlabeled data. These features form a succinct input representation and significantly improve classification performance. When using an SVM for classification, we further show how a Fisher kernel can be learned for this representation.",

Successful adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) created an explosion in digital clinical data available for analysis, but progress in machine learning for healthcare research has been difficult to measure because of the absence of publicly available benchmark data sets. To address this problem, we propose four clinical prediction benchmarks using data derived from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. These tasks cover a range of clinical problems including modeling risk of mortality, forecasting length of stay, detecting physiologic decline, and phenotype classification. We propose strong linear and neural baselines for all four tasks and evaluate the effect of deep supervision, multitask training and data-specific architectural modifications on the performance of neural models.",

        "title": "A Sentiment Analysis of Breast Cancer Treatment Experiences and Healthcare Perceptions Across Twitter",
        "abstract": "Background: Social media has the capacity to afford the healthcare industry with valuable feedback from patients who reveal and express their medical decision-making process, as well as self-reported quality of life indicators both during and post treatment. In prior work, [Crannell et. al.], we have studied an active cancer patient population on Twitter and compiled a set of tweets describing their experience with this disease. We refer to these online public testimonies as \"Invisible Patient Reported Outcomes\" (iPROs), because they carry relevant indicators, yet are difficult to capture by conventional means of self-report. Methods: Our present study aims to identify tweets related to the patient experience as an additional informative tool for monitoring public health. Using Twitter's public streaming API, we compiled over 5.3 million \"breast cancer\" related tweets spanning September 2016 until mid December 2017. We combined supervised machine learning methods with natural language processing to sift tweets relevant to breast cancer patient experiences. We analyzed a sample of 845 breast cancer patient and survivor accounts, responsible for over 48,000 posts. We investigated tweet content with a hedonometric sentiment analysis to quantitatively extract emotionally charged topics. Results: We found that positive experiences were shared regarding patient treatment, raising support, and spreading awareness. Further discussions related to healthcare were prevalent and largely negative focusing on fear of political legislation that could result in loss of coverage. Conclusions: Social media can provide a positive outlet for patients to discuss their needs and concerns regarding their healthcare coverage and treatment needs. Capturing iPROs from online communication can help inform healthcare professionals and lead to more connected and personalized treatment regimens.",

For a popular product, there are a large number of reviews. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to make an informed decision on purchasing the product, as well as for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. In this paper, we pay attention to online hotel reviews, and propose a supervised machine learning approach using unigram feature with two types of information (frequency and TF-IDF) to realize polarity classification of documents. As shown in our experimental results, the information of TF-IDF is more effective than frequency.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning is a quite useful and proliferating technique of machine learning. Various applications, such as medical images analysis, medical images processing, text understanding, and speech recognition, have been using deep learning, and it has been providing rather promising results. Both supervised and unsupervised approaches are being used to extract and learn features as well as for the multi-level representation of pattern recognition and classification. Hence, the way of prediction, recognition, and diagnosis in various domains of healthcare including the abdomen, lung cancer, brain tumor, skeletal bone age assessment, and so on, have been transformed and improved significantly by deep learning. By considering a wide range of deep-learning applications, the main aim of this paper is to present a detailed survey on emerging research of deep-learning models for bone age assessment (e.g., segmentation, prediction, and classification). An enormous number of scientific research publications related to bone age assessment using deep learning are explored, studied, and presented in this survey. Furthermore, the emerging trends of this research domain have been analyzed and discussed. Finally, a critical discussion section on the limitations of deep-learning models has been presented. Open research challenges and future directions in this promising area have been included as well.",

        "title": "Prediction of Preterm Deliveries from EHG Signals Using Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "There has been some improvement in the treatment of preterm infants, which has helped to increase their chance of survival. However, the rate of premature births is still globally increasing. As a result, this group of infants are most at risk of developing severe medical conditions that can affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, immune, central nervous, auditory and visual systems. In extreme cases, this can also lead to long-term conditions, such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, learning difficulties, including poor health and growth. In the US alone, the societal and economic cost of preterm births, in 2005, was estimated to be $26.2 billion, per annum. In the UK, this value was close to £2.95 billion, in 2009. Many believe that a better understanding of why preterm births occur, and a strategic focus on prevention, will help to improve the health of children and reduce healthcare costs. At present, most methods of preterm birth prediction are subjective. However, a strong body of evidence suggests the analysis of uterine electrical signals (Electrohysterography), could provide a viable way of diagnosing true labour and predict preterm deliveries. Most Electrohysterography studies focus on true labour detection during the final seven days, before labour. The challenge is to utilise Electrohysterography techniques to predict preterm delivery earlier in the pregnancy. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies term and preterm records, using an open source dataset containing 300 records (38 preterm and 262 term). The synthetic minority oversampling technique is used to oversample the minority preterm class, and cross validation techniques, are used to evaluate the dataset against other similar studies. Our approach shows an improvement on existing studies with 96% sensitivity, 90% specificity, and a 95% area under the curve value with 8% global error using the polynomial classifier.",

        "abstract": "In healthcare industry, Neural Network has attained a milestone in solving many real-life classification problems varies from very simple to complex and from linear to non-linear. To improve the training process by reducing the training time, Adaptive Skipping Training algorithm named as Half of Threshold (HOT) has been proposed. To perform the fast classification and also to improve the computational efficiency such as accuracy, error rate, etc., the highlighted characteristics of proposed HOT algorithm has been integrated with Strassen’s matrix multiplication algorithm and derived a novel, hybrid and computationally efficient algorithm for training and validating the neural network named as Strassen’s Half of Threshold (SHoT) Training Algorithm. The experimental outcome based on the simulation demonstrated that the proposed SHOT algorithm outperforms both BPN and HOT algorithm in terms of training time which is reduced with the range of 7% to 54% and its efficiency which is improved with the range of 3% to 15% on various dataset such as Hepatitis, SPeCT, Heart, Liver Disorders, Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic), Drug Consumption, Cardiotocography, Splice-junction Gene Sequences and Thyroid Disease dataset that are extracted from Machine Learning Dataset Repository of UCI. It can be integrated with any type of supervised training algorithm.",

        "title": "A Semi-supervised Approach for De-identification of Swedish Clinical Text",
        "abstract": "An abundance of electronic health records (EHR) is produced every day within healthcare. The records possess valuable information for research and future improvement of healthcare. Multiple efforts have been done to protect the integrity of patients while making electronic health records usable for research by removing personally identifiable information in patient records. Supervised machine learning approaches for de-identification of EHRs need annotated data for training, annotations that are costly in time and human resources. The annotation costs for clinical text is even more costly as the process must be carried out in a protected environment with a limited number of annotators who must have signed confidentiality agreements. In this paper is therefore, a semi-supervised method proposed, for automatically creating high-quality training data. The study shows that the method can be used to improve recall from 84.75% to 89.20% without sacrificing precision to the same extent, dropping from 95.73% to 94.20%. The model’s recall is arguably more important for de-identification than precision.",

        "title": "Ensemble of Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection in Biomedical Data: A Narrative Review",
        "abstract": "In the context of biomedical data, an anomaly could refer to a rare or new type of disease, an aberration from normal behavior, or an unexpected observation requiring immediate attention. The detection of anomalies in biomedical data has a direct impact on the health and safety of individuals. However, anomalous events are rare, diverse, and infrequent. Often, the collection of anomalous data may involve significant loss of human life and healthcare costs. Therefore, traditional supervised machine and deep learning algorithms may not be directly applicable to such problems. Biomedical data are often collected in the form of images, electronic health records, and time series. Typically, an autoencoder (AE) or its corresponding variant is trained on normal data, and an anomaly is identified as a significant deviation from these data based on reconstruction error or other metrics. An Ensemble of AEs (EoAEs) can serve as a robust approach for anomaly detection in biomedical data by combining diverse and accurate views of normal data. An EoAE can provide superior detection to a single encoder; however, its performance can depend on various factors, including the diversity of the created data, the accuracy of the individual AEs, and the combination of their outcomes. Herein, we perform a comprehensive narrative literature review on the use of EoAEs when using different types of biomedical data. Such an ensemble provides a promising approach for anomaly detection in biomedical data, offering the potential for performance improvement by leveraging the strengths of diverse AEs. However, several challenges remain, such as the need for data specification and determination of the optimal number of AEs in the ensemble. By addressing these challenges, researchers can enhance the effectiveness of EoAEs for anomaly detection in various types of biomedical data. Furthermore, through this review, we highlight the significance of evaluating and comparing the performance of an EoAE with that of single AEs by establishing agreed-upon evaluation metrics and investigating normalization techniques for anomaly scores. We conclude the review by presenting challenges and open questions in the field with for future research.",

Approaches to automate longtudinal analysis present many challenges including lack of available longitudinal datasets, managing complex large multimodal imaging examinations, and need for detailed annotations for traditional supervised machine learning. In this work we develop OncoNet, novel machine learning algorithm that assesses treatment response from a 1,954 pairs of sequential FDG PET/CT exams through weak supervision using the standard uptake values (SUVmax) in associated radiology reports. OncoNet demonstrates an AUROC of 0.86 and 0.84 on internal and external institution test sets respectively for determination of change between scans while also showing strong agreement to clinical scoring systems with a kappa score of 0.8. We also curated a dataset of 1,954 paired FDG PET/CT exams designed for response assessment for the broader machine learning in healthcare research community. Automated assessment of radiographic response from FDG PET/CT with OncoNet could provide clinicians with a valuable tool to rapidly and consistently interpret change over time in longitudinal multi-modal imaging exams.",

People with diabetes are among the most susceptible to novel corona virus (COVID-19) infection and may grieve from serious lungs infections, difficulties in breathing, or even death. It is a motive of world-wide apprehension as the cases are intensifying hastily. In the current scenario with the advent and outstretched growth of Machine learning (ML), the computer assisted automatic disease diagnosis in healthcare segment is speedily growing. The present research aims to apply supervised ML practises on Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) corpus to diagnose disease for the females and assist the doctors and health care professionals. The empirical research is carried out using three different predictive models namely support vector machine (SVM) with linear, RBF, Polynomial, sigmoid functions, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and Random forest (RF).The random forest model has delivered an improved accuracy of 76%.The performance of three models is measured by using accuracy, precision and recall.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a general framework for sparse semi-supervised learning, which concerns using a small portion of unlabeled data and a few labeled data to represent target functions and thus has the merit of accelerating function evaluations when predicting the output of a new example. This framework makes use of Fenchel-Legendre conjugates to rewrite a convex insensitive loss involving a regularization with unlabeled data, and is applicable to a family of semi-supervised learning methods such as multi-view co-regularized least squares and single-view Laplacian support vector machines (SVMs). As an instantiation of this framework, we propose sparse multi-view SVMs which use a squared e-insensitive loss. The resultant optimization is an inf-sup problem and the optimal solutions have arguably saddle-point properties. We present a globally optimal iterative algorithm to optimize the problem. We give the margin bound on the generalization error of the sparse multi-view SVMs, and derive the empirical Rademacher complexity for the induced function class. Experiments on artificial and real-world data show their effectiveness. We further give a sequential training approach to show their possibility and potential for uses in large-scale problems and provide encouraging experimental results indicating the efficacy of the margin bound and empirical Rademacher complexity on characterizing the roles of unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning.",

        "abstract": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods play an increasingly important role in practical machine learning systems, particularly in agnostic settings when no parametric information or other prior knowledge is available about the data distribution. Given the constructed graph represented by a weight matrix, transductive inference is used to propagate known labels to predict the values of all unlabeled vertices. Designing a robust label diffusion algorithm for such graphs is a widely studied problem and various methods have recently been suggested. Many of these can be formalized as regularized function estimation through the minimization of a quadratic cost. However, most existing label diffusion methods minimize a univariate cost with the classification function as the only variable of interest. Since the observed labels seed the diffusion process, such univariate frameworks are extremely sensitive to the initial label choice and any label noise. To alleviate the dependency on the initial observed labels, this article proposes a bivariate formulation for graph-based SSL, where both the binary label information and a continuous classification function are arguments of the optimization. This bivariate formulation is shown to be equivalent to a linearly constrained Max-Cut problem. Finally an efficient solution via greedy gradient Max-Cut (GGMC) is derived which gradually assigns unlabeled vertices to each class with minimum connectivity. Once convergence guarantees are established, this greedy Max-Cut based SSL is applied on both artificial and standard benchmark data sets where it obtains superior classification accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art SSL methods. Moreover, GGMC shows robustness with respect to the graph construction method and maintains high accuracy over extensive experiments with various edge linking and weighting schemes.",

        "abstract": "This research-to-practice full paper represents our work to comprehensively analyze cloud computing benchmarking with integrated AI-driven healthcare projects. As time progresses, the need to migrate a variety of system applications to the cloud has grown significantly. Yet, choosing a particular cloud service provider can be troublesome and proposes several challenges, whether computational or financial, depending on the domain of the application. Thus, the reliance on cloud platform benchmarking has become an essential skill engineers must develop in order to make informed and efficient decisions. Healthcare applications, in particular, constitute an excellent from-ground- to-cloud example that we needed to analyze and study, especially from the perspective of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. At the moment, there is high demand for AI applications in the domain of healthcare seeking higher performance while lowering the costs of the services. Nonetheless, the healthcare domain is considered a tough field to experience and experiment to new graduates and proposes challenges to successfully cloudify the designated system applications. Therefore, we developed an effectual pedagogical approach capable of addressing those stacked challenges and preparing a new generation of competent engineers. Our work is designed to implement multiple stages sequentially and individually. The first stage commences by introducing students to various concepts as a foundation for their core work, covering Machine Learning (ML) basics, healthcare domain knowledge basics, finding a solution via ground and cloud computation, and benchmarking. Students then attempted to address a chosen healthcare problem using AI techniques. Finally, they solve the proposed healthcare challenge and successfully benchmark the cloud platforms of both Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Students, as instructed, relied on concepts of metrics, measurements, criteria, and their disparities to accurately assess each cloud. This paper efficiently documents and analyzes the results of each proposed stage based on the represented students' deliverables and the supervisors' feedback to reflect the effectiveness of the suggested teaching approach.",

        "title": "Self-Supervised Transformers for Activity Classification using Ambient Sensors",
        "abstract": "Providing care for ageing populations is an onerous task, and as life expectancy estimates continue to rise, the number of people that require senior care is growing rapidly. This paper proposes a methodology based on Transformer Neural Networks to classify the activities of a resident within an ambient sensor based environment. We also propose a methodology to pre-train Transformers in a self-supervised manner, as a hybrid autoencoder-classifier model instead of using contrastive loss. The social impact of the research is considered with wider benefits of the approach and next steps for identifying transitions in human behaviour. In recent years there has been an increasing drive for integrating sensor based technologies within care facilities for data collection. This allows for employing machine learning for many aspects including activity recognition and anomaly detection. Due to the sensitivity of healthcare environments, some methods of data collection used in current research are considered to be intrusive within the senior care industry, including cameras for image based activity recognition, and wearables for activity tracking, but recent studies have shown that using these methods commonly result in poor data quality due to the lack of resident interest in participating in data gathering. This has led to a focus on ambient sensors, such as binary PIR motion, connected domestic appliances, and electricity and water metering. By having consistency in ambient data collection, the quality of data is considerably more reliable, presenting the opportunity to perform classification with enhanced accuracy. Therefore, in this research we looked to find an optimal way of using deep learning to classify human activity with ambient sensor data.",

The application of AI technologies in the medical and healthcare sector offers significant potential benefit. In this paper, the integration of AI into healthcare research is introduced to encourage more medical and healthcare experts to research this promising cross-disciplinary area. After introducing the basic concepts that underlie AI, the two major schools of machine learning approaches, namely 'supervised learning' and 'unsupervised learning', are discussed. Next, two commonly used algorithms (artificial neural networks and decision trees) are discussed. The paper then focuses on three healthcare applications of AI technologies, including predicting postoperative mortality, quality of life in older adults, and risk of dementia. Finally, the challenges to integrating AI into healthcare research such as class imbalance, missing data, and data scarcity are discussed along with feasible approaches to resolving these challenges.",

        "abstract": "Student evaluations of teaching (SET) provides potentially essential source of information to achieve educational quality objectives of higher educational institutions. The findings can be utilized as a measure of teaching effectiveness and they may aid the administrative decision‐making process. The purpose of our research is to establish an efficient sentiment classification scheme on instructor evaluation reviews by pursuing the paradigm of deep learning. Deep learning is a recent research direction of machine learning, which seeks to identify a classification scheme with higher predictive performance based on multiple layers of nonlinear information processing. In this study, we present a recurrent neural network (RNN) based model for opinion mining on instructor evaluation reviews. We analyze a corpus containing 154,000 such reviews, with the use of conventional machine learning algorithms, ensemble learning methods, and deep learning architectures. In the empirical analysis, three conventional text representation schemes (namely, term‐presence, term‐frequency [TF], and TF‐inverse document frequency schemes) and four word embedding schemes (namely, word2vec, global vector [GloVe], fastText, and LDA2Vec) have been taken into consideration. The predictive performance of supervised machine learning methods (such as, Naïve Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression, K‐nearest neighbor, and random forest) and three ensemble learning methods have been examined on word embedding schemes. The extensive empirical analysis indicates that deep learning‐based architectures outperform the conventional machine learning classifiers for the task of sentiment classification on instructor reviews. For the RNN with attention mechanism in conjunction with GloVe word embedding scheme‐based representation a classification accuracy of 98.29% has been obtained.",

        "abstract": "This paper shows the feasibility of fluid intake estimation using earphone sensors, which are gaining in popularity. Fluid consumption estimation has a number of healthcare-related applications in tracking dehydration and overhydration which can be connected to issues in fatigue, irritability, high blood pressure, kidney stones, etc. Therefore, accurate tracking of hydration levels not only has direct benefits to users in preventing such disorders but also offers diagnostic information to healthcare providers. Towards this end, this paper employs a voice pickup microphone that captures body vibrations during fluid consumption directly from skin contact and body conduction. This results in the extraction of stronger signals while being immune to ambient environmental noise. However, the main challenge for accurate estimation is the lack of availability of large-scale training datasets to train machine learning models (ML). To address the challenge, this paper designs robust ML models based on techniques in data augmentation and semi-supervised learning. Extensive user study with 12 users shows a per-swallow volume estimation accuracy of 3.35 mL (≈ 19.17% error) and a cumulative error of 3.26% over an entire bottle, while being robust to body motion, container type, liquid temperature, sensor position, etc. The ML models are implemented on smartphones with low power consumption and latency.",

        "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and gait deficits are commonly associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Early detection of MCI associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD-MCI) and its biomarkers is critical to managing disability in PD patients, reducing caregiver burden and healthcare costs. Gait is considered a surrogate marker for cognitive decline in PD. However, gait kinematic and kinetic features in PD-MCI patients remain unknown. This study was designed to explore the difference in gait kinematics and kinetics during single-task and dual-task walking between PD patients with and without MCI. Kinematic and kinetic data of 90 PD patients were collected using 3D motion capture system. Differences in gait kinematic and kinetic gait features between groups were identified by using: first, univariate statistical analysis and then a supervised machine learning analysis. The findings of this study showed that the presence of MCI in PD patients is coupled with kinematic and kinetic deviations of gait cycle which may eventually identify two different phenotypes of the disease. Indeed, as shown by the demographical and clinical comparison between the two groups, PD-MCI patients were older and more impaired. Moreover, PD-MCI kinematic results showed that cognitive dysfunction coexists with more severe axial symptoms and an increase postural flexion. A lack of physiological distal-to-proximal shift in joint kinetics was evidenced in the PD phenotype associated with cognitive impairments.",

        "abstract": "The Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are an essential class of supervised learning algorithms. Complex tasks like speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment classification, weather prediction, etc., are now performed by well-trained RNNs. Local or cloud-based GPU machines are used to train them. However, inference is now shifting to miniature, mobile, IoT devices and even micro-controllers. Due to their colossal memory and computing requirements, mapping RNNs directly onto resource-constrained platforms is arcane and challenging. The efficacy of edge-intelligent RNNs (EI-RNNs) must satisfy both performance and memory-fitting requirements at the same time without compromising one for the other. This study’s aim was to provide an empirical evaluation and optimization of historic as well as recent RNN architectures for high-performance and low-memory footprint goals. We focused on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks based on wearable sensor data for embedded healthcare applications. We evaluated and optimized six different recurrent units, namely Vanilla RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), Fast Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (FGRNNs), Fast Recurrent Neural Networks (FRNNs), and Unitary Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (UGRNNs) on eight publicly available time-series HAR datasets. We used the hold-out and cross-validation protocols for training the RNNs. We used low-rank parameterization, iterative hard thresholding, and spare retraining compression for RNNs. We found that efficient training (i.e., dataset handling and preprocessing procedures, hyperparameter tuning, and so on, and suitable compression methods (like low-rank parameterization and iterative pruning) are critical in optimizing RNNs for performance and memory efficiency. We implemented the inference of the optimized models on Raspberry Pi.",

        "abstract": "Predictive algorithms, also known as mathematical models, utilize historical data to accurately predict future outcomes. These algorithms identify patterns and relationships within the data, resulting in precise predictions. The growing importance of predictive algorithms in various domains, such as finance, healthcare, marketing, weather forecasting, E-commerce, etc., has led to an increasing need for robust and accurate models. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, & reinforcement learning, play a crucial role in prediction. Supervised algorithms include classification and regression, while unsupervised algorithms primarily focus on clustering. In this study, a detailed comparative analysis of eight classification algorithms, six regression algorithms, and five clustering algorithms is performed using diverse datasets and performance metrics. ROBERTA, ResNet, Random Forest Regression, and K-means clustering algorithms outperformed traditional algorithms in textual classification, image classification, regression, and clustering. This study enables data scientists and practitioners to make informed decisions when selecting appropriate models for their specific applications.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.",

        "abstract": "Melanoma is considered to be one of the most dangerous human malignancy, which is diagnosed visually or by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. However, as these traditional methods are based on human experience and implemented manually, there have been great limitations for general usability in current clinical practice. In this paper, a novel hybrid machine learning approach is proposed to identify melanoma for skin healthcare in various cases. The proposed approach consists of classic machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), EfficientNet, and XGBoost supervised machine learning. In the proposed approach, a deep learning model is trained directly from raw pixels and image labels for classification of skin lesions. Then, solely based on modeling of various features from patients, an XGBoost model is adopted to predict skin cancer. Following that, a diagnostic system which composed of the deep learning model and XGBoost model is developed to further improve the prediction efficiency and accuracy. Different from experience-based methods and solely image-based machine learning methods, the proposed approach is developed based on the theory of deep learning and feature engineering. Experiments show that the hybrid model outperforms single model like the traditional deep learning model or XGBoost model. Moreover, the data-driven-based characteristics can help the proposed approach develop a guideline for image analysis in other medical applications.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson’s Disease is a kind of nervous system disorder whose symptoms start gradually. The signs and symptoms can be different for everyone with no specific diagnosis. Neurological disorders are identified as global threat with Parkinson’s Disease being the second most common. More than 10 billion people are living with Parkinson’s around the world. This disease is most common in countries of the US and Canada. Deep learning an essential part of Artificial Intelligence provides an uncanny power to systems to construct a complex network using layers of perceptrons that mimic the human neurons. This network Combined with algorithms of Machine Learning and Prognostic Modeling may serve as one of the most powerful tools in healthcare to classify and analyze huge amount of medical data and predict future trends through Supervised Learning. In the paper, we focused on the effective prediction of the organ at risk for Parkinson’s Disease (Multi-label Classification). We have examined and refined our model over data collected across data collection of over 300 features. We have put forward an Artificial Neural Network organ risk prediction algorithm using contrasting data. To our finest understanding, none of the previous works have centered on contrasting data in the area of analysis of medical data. The prediction accuracy of our suggested ANN algorithm is 76%.",

        "title": "Evaluating multiple models using labeled and unlabeled data",
        "abstract": "It remains difficult to evaluate machine learning classifiers in the absence of a large, labeled dataset. While labeled data can be prohibitively expensive or impossible to obtain, unlabeled data is plentiful. Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Model Evaluation (SSME), a method that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to evaluate machine learning classifiers. SSME is the first evaluation method to take advantage of the fact that: (i) there are frequently multiple classifiers for the same task, (ii) continuous classifier scores are often available for all classes, and (iii) unlabeled data is often far more plentiful than labeled data. The key idea is to use a semi-supervised mixture model to estimate the joint distribution of ground truth labels and classifier predictions. We can then use this model to estimate any metric that is a function of classifier scores and ground truth labels (e.g., accuracy or expected calibration error). We present experiments in four domains where obtaining large labeled datasets is often impractical: (1) healthcare, (2) content moderation, (3) molecular property prediction, and (4) image annotation. Our results demonstrate that SSME estimates performance more accurately than do competing methods, reducing error by 5.1x relative to using labeled data alone and 2.4x relative to the next best competing method. SSME also improves accuracy when evaluating performance across subsets of the test distribution (e.g., specific demographic subgroups) and when evaluating the performance of language models.",

        "abstract": "Obtaining large annotated datasets is critical for training successful machine learning models and it is often a bottleneck in practice. Weak supervision offers a promising alternative for producing labeled datasets without ground truth annotations by generating probabilistic labels using multiple noisy heuristics. This process can scale to large datasets and has demonstrated state of the art performance in diverse domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. One practical issue with learning from user-generated heuristics is that their creation requires creativity, foresight, and domain expertise from those who hand-craft them, a process which can be tedious and subjective. We develop the first framework for interactive weak supervision in which a method proposes heuristics and learns from user feedback given on each proposed heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that only a small number of feedback iterations are needed to train models that achieve highly competitive test set performance without access to ground truth training labels. We conduct user studies, which show that users are able to effectively provide feedback on heuristics and that test set results track the performance of simulated oracles.",

        "abstract": "Intrusion Detection Systems (FIDSs) with foamy disturbance are crucial for preventing security breaches in the constantly growing world of the internet's interconnectivity across many domains. Among the many applications are supply chains, manufacturing, smart homes, smart grids, healthcare, and environmental tracking. Traditional intrusion detection methods, while effective in conventional contexts, require adaptation and enhancement to cater to the unique challenges, including devices with limited resources, memory, and battery capacity, as well as particular protocol stacks. In this study, we develop a lightweight attack detection method that detects and stops attackers from injecting superfluous data into the network using a supervised machine learning-based FIDS. Our simulation results demonstrate that the suggested FIDS- based classifier works well in terms of classification accuracy and detection speed when it is enhanced by a combination of two or three complex features.",

Traditional supervised machine learning approaches using large language models (LLMs) to summarize clinical text have struggled due to hallucinations and lack of relevant training data. Here, we present a novel, simplified solution for the “Discharge Me!” shared task. Our approach mimics human clinical workflow, using pre-trained LLMs to answer specific questions and summarize the answers obtained from discharge summaries and other EHR sections. This method (i) avoids hallucinations through hybrid-RAG/zero-shot contextualized prompting; (ii) requires no extensive training or fine-tuning; and (iii) is adaptable to various clinical tasks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is a discipline within the field of computer science that encompasses the development and utilization of machines capable of emulating human behavior, particularly regarding the astute examination and interpretation of data. AI operates through the utilization of specialized algorithms, and it includes techniques such as deep (DL), and machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP). As a result, AI has found its application in the study of pharmaceutical chemistry and healthcare. The AI models employed encompass a spectrum of methodologies, including unsupervised clustering techniques applied to drugs or patients to discern potential drug compounds or appropriate patient cohorts. Additionally, supervised ML methodologies are utilized to enhance the efficacy of therapeutic drug monitoring. Further, AI-aided prediction of the clinical outcomes of clinical trials can improve efficiency by prioritizing therapeutic intervention that are likely to succeed, hence benefiting the patient. AI may also help create personalized treatments by locating potential intervention targets and assessing their efficacy. Hence, this review provides insights into recent advances in the application of AI and different tools used in the field of pharmaceutical medicine.",

        "abstract": "Supervised deep learning methods have produced state-of-the-art results with large labeled datasets. However, accessing large labeled datasets is difficult in medical image analysis because of a shortage of medical experts, expensive annotations, and privacy constraints in the healthcare domain. Self-supervised learning is a branch of machine learning that exploits unlabeled data to encourage network weights toward a valid latent representation of the data during a so-called pretext task. The features learned by the model while solving pretext tasks are transferred to a downstream task where limited annotations are available. In this work, we propose PatchLoc, a novel pretext task whose objective is to find the location of a given patch from an image as a source of supervision. We validated the effectiveness of PatchLoc on a downstream segmentation task using three different medical datasets. PatchLoc yields substantial improvements compared to U-Net trained from scratch and other pretext task-based approaches in a low data regime.",

We open source the corresponding codebase, datasets, MSAs, structures, model predictions and develop a user-friendly website that facilitates data access and analysis.",

        "abstract": "Hospital readmission within a 30-day period causes severe economic and healthcare impacts. According to a study, 76% of the hospitals readmissions can be prevented by providing out of hospital post-discharge care. In order to appropriately mark the patients with high chances of getting readmitted, numerous studies and researches have been performed which uses various supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the readmission probability of a patient using labeled discharge summaries and clinical notes. The datasets used in these studies are highly imbalanced and has high dimensionality, which affects classification performance negatively. This study uses data sampling technique to reduce the imbalance and feature selection technique to reduce high dimensionality, thereby improving the overall classification performance and reducing the evaluation time as compared to other industry standard hospital readmission frameworks reviewed in this study.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare is experiencing a transformative phase, with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Physical therapists (PTs) stand on the brink of a paradigm shift in education, practice, and research. Rather than visualizing AI as a threat, it presents an opportunity to revolutionize. This paper examines how large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and BioMedLM, driven by deep ML can offer human-like performance but face challenges in accuracy due to vast data in PT and rehabilitation practice. PTs can benefit by developing and training an LLM specifically for streamlining administrative tasks, connecting globally, and customizing treatments using LLMs. However, human touch and creativity remain invaluable. This paper urges PTs to engage in learning and shaping AI models by highlighting the need for ethical use and human supervision to address potential biases. Embracing AI as a contributor, and not just a user, is crucial by integrating AI, fostering collaboration for a future in which AI enriches the PT field provided data accuracy, and the challenges associated with feeding the AI model are sensitively addressed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we study statistical properties of semi-supervised learning, which is considered to be an important problem in the field of machine learning. In standard supervised learning only labeled data is observed, and classification and regression problems are formalized as supervised learning. On the other hand, in semi-supervised learning, unlabeled data is also obtained in addition to labeled data. Hence, the ability to exploit unlabeled data is important to improve prediction accuracy in semi-supervised learning. This problem is regarded as a semiparametric estimation problem with missing data. Under discriminative probabilistic models, it was considered that unlabeled data is useless to improve the estimation accuracy. Recently, the weighted estimator using unlabeled data achieves a better prediction accuracy compared to the learning method using only labeled data, especially when the discriminative probabilistic model is misspecified. That is, improvement under the semiparametric model with missing data is possible when the semiparametric model is misspecified. In this paper, we apply the density-ratio estimator to obtain the weight function in semi-supervised learning. Our approach is advantageous because the proposed estimator does not require well-specified probabilistic models for the probability of the unlabeled data. Based on statistical asymptotic theory, we prove that the estimation accuracy of our method outperforms supervised learning using only labeled data. Some numerical experiments present the usefulness of our methods.",

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as the most promising approaches to automate the CHA process. In this paper, we explore the background of CHA and delve into the extensive research recently undertaken in this domain to provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art. In particular, a careful selection of significant works published in the literature is reviewed to elaborate a range of enabling technologies and AI/ML techniques used for CHA, including conventional supervised and unsupervised machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and image processing techniques. Furthermore, we provide an overview of various means of data acquisition and the benchmark datasets. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in using AI and ML for CHA along with some possible solutions. In summary, this paper presents CHA tools, lists various data acquisition methods for CHA, provides technological advancements, presents the usage of AI for CHA, and open issues, challenges in the CHA domain. We hope this first-of-its-kind survey paper will significantly contribute to identifying research gaps in the complex and rapidly evolving interdisciplinary mental health field.",

        "abstract": "As the world produces exabytes of data, there is a growing need to find new methods that are more suitable for dealing with complex datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential to impact the healthcare industry, which is already on the road to change with the digital transformation of vast quantities of information. The implementation of AI has already achieved success in the domains of molecular chemistry and drug discoveries. The reduction in costs and in the time needed for experiments to predict the pharmacological activities of new molecules is a milestone in science. These successful applications of AI algorithms provide hope for a revolution in healthcare systems. A significant part of artificial intelligence is machine learning (ML), of which there are three main types—supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In this review, the full scope of the AI workflow is presented, with explanations of the most-often-used ML algorithms and descriptions of performance metrics for both regression and classification. A brief introduction to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is provided, with examples of technologies that have developed for XAI. We review important AI implementations in cardiology for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning and natural language processing, emphasizing the used algorithm. Finally, we discuss the need to establish legal, ethical, and methodical requirements for the deployment of AI models in medicine.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a foremost cause of mortality among and prevalent malignancy globally, constituting 30 % of all cancer diagnoses in women as of 2022. Timely detection of cancer before metastasis and accurate diagnosis of tumors as malignant poses a significant challenge in healthcare. Deploying accurate predictive models is crucial for facilitating life-saving early interventions. This study presents a comparative evaluation of Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms for tumor type through the analysis of patient tumor structure quantification. Our research employed supervised ML algorithms that distinguish between malignant and benign tumors using tuning parameters to discern the optimal configurations for multiplying precision and minimizing the error rates. Additionally, a comparative analysis of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms is carried out. The study's findings highlight the superiority of the RF Classification model, which attained an impressive 97 % accuracy, surpassing KNN and LR, with recorded accuracies of 96% and 94 %, respectively. Furthermore, performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, true and false positive and negative rates, and area under the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) were applied for a comprehensive analysis of the algorithms. The results reveal improved accuracy compared to existing literature by 0.9 %. Although limited to a single dataset, our methodology shows promising results for real-world applications using analogous input parameters. Future research should aim for the application of advanced tuning encompassing Deep Learning and Neural Networks.",

Hypertension, obesity, stroke etc. have become common phenomenon for a large part of population. In between all this, it is very important to be able to identify / at least predict possible diseases as soon as possible so that human lives are saved. Also, in recent years, healthcare industry has moved on from purely traditional disease diagnosis methods to also using new technology like Internet Of Things (IoT), Machine learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence(AI) etc. for effective disease diagnosis. ML is a recently developed technology which is trained using proven data (previous patient data) which, here, will be provided by hospitals, etc. And using that, we will attempt to create an ML model which would predict the possible diseases one may have based on his symptoms. ML will help the system to predict automatically without any human intervention as needed by traditional diagnosis systems. ML can be supervised / unsupervised. But we will be only trying to find a solution using supervised learning.",

        "abstract": "Through the implementation of an effective post-discharge patient monitoring system, we intend to significantly reduce the risk of Cognitive Heart Failure (CHF). This study proposes a highly advanced machine-learning platform for real-time detection and risk assessment of current patient data. More specifically, reinforced learning and supervised learning will be used. We also plan to integrate historical data, providing both healthcare providers and patients with more accurate results. Patients can enter daily health metrics to facilitate trend analysis and capture oncoming health issues. After this input, the patient data will be assessed with a built-in risk assessment algorithm developed by our model. Based on results from this algorithm, healthcare providers will be notified. This patient-centered design facilitates the process of proactive care, enhances the level of communication between patients and their providers, and shortens diagnosis and time required for treatment initiation. Data sources used by the platform to model predictive ability include PhysioNet, OpenNeuro, and OpenfMRI. Rigorous validation through clinical trials shall prove the reliability, effectiveness, and scalability of the platform toward bettering patient outcomes and supporting global healthcare enhancements. Through this continuously adapting model, we hope to successfully bridge the gap between accurate healthcare monitoring and post-discharge care. Clinical Relevance- Currently, healthcare providers are not able to have an easy method of tracking patient conditions post-discharge, especially when it comes to chronic conditions like Cognitive Heart Failure (CHF). This model allows for both providers and patients to have a device that simulates whether or not the patients need to go in for a check-up, based on the machine learning and risk assessment model that we developed. This can significantly improve patient-provider communication.",

Similarly Diabetes, one of the frequently spreading disease is growing hastily in all of the Nations nowadays. According to WHO, approximately 422 million humans globally have diabetes and 1.5 million deaths are without delay associated with diabetes disorder. So the effective analysis should be made to detect the presence of disease before it kills the patient which reflects a plenty of studies have been made in the field of healthcare. In this paper, we are going to predict these two diseases through one of the data mining techniques called classification. The analysis is completed using Jupyter Notebook. One of the data mining techniques called supervised learning or the classification is applied in which we have used Decision tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor. The data in this research paper is taken from University of California Irvine repository of machine learning. The main aim of this paper is to provide brief prediction on both diabetes and liver disease and the goal is to provide a better final results when compared to the other algorithms, for the disease prediction. In results we are predicting the presence of diabetes disease with 98% of accuracy with Random forest algorithm and prediction of liver disorder has 81.59% of accuracy with Random Forest algorithm along with accuracy we have attempted to use some parameters like precision, recall, F-Measure for the evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has risen steadily, including a wide range of applications in the field of pharmacology. AI is now used throughout the entire continuum of pharmacology research and clinical practice and from early drug discovery to real-world data mining. The types of AI models used range from unsupervised clustering of drugs or patients aimed at identifying potential drug compounds or suitable patient populations, to supervised machine learning approaches to improve therapeutic drug monitoring. Additionally, natural language processing is increasingly used to mine electronic health records to obtain real-world data. In this mini-review, we discuss the basics of AI followed by an outline of its application in pharmacology research and clinical practice. Artificial intelligence is the upcoming technology in advance health care system. Current digitalization of medicine and availability of electronic health records (EHRs) has inspired clinical researchers and healthcare personnel to acquire artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies for big data analytics and for very large scale medical databases. The major advantage of AI is that it reduces the time that is needed for drug development and, in turn, it reduces the costs that are associated with drug development, enhances the returns on investment and may even cause a decrease in cost for the end user. A large number of researches are being carried out to improve the current available AI technology to make the pharmacy profession more efficient. The present article briefly describes the importance of AI in the process of drug development and then looks at the various AI tools that are available at the disposal of a modern-day pharmacist to aid in a more efficient functioning.",

However, ML models require a large number of annotated examples to provide satisfactory results, which is not possible in most healthcare scenarios due to the high cost of clinician-labeled data. Active Learning (AL) is a process of selecting the most informative instances to be labeled by an expert to further train a supervised algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AL in multi-label text classification in the clinical domain. In this context, we apply a set of well-known AL methods to help automatically assign ICD-9 codes on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our results show that the selection of informative instances provides satisfactory classification with a significantly reduced training set (8.3\\% of the total instances). We conclude that AL methods can significantly reduce the manual annotation cost while preserving model performance.",

        "title": "Data reduction techniques for highly imbalanced medicare Big Data",
        "abstract": "In the domain of Medicare insurance fraud detection, handling imbalanced Big Data and high dimensionality remains a significant challenge. This study assesses the combined efficacy of two data reduction techniques: Random Undersampling (RUS), and a novel ensemble supervised feature selection method. The techniques are applied to optimize Machine Learning models for fraud identification in the classification of highly imbalanced Big Medicare Data. Utilizing two datasets from The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) labeled by the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), our principal contribution lies in empirically demonstrating that data reduction techniques applied to these datasets significantly improves classification performance. The study employs a systematic experimental design to investigate various scenarios, ranging from using each technique in isolation to employing them in combination. The results indicate that a synergistic application of both techniques outperforms models that utilize all available features and data. Moreover, reduction in the number of features leads to more explainable models. Given the enormous financial implications of Medicare fraud, our findings not only offer computational advantages but also significantly enhance the effectiveness of fraud detection systems, thereby having the potential to improve healthcare services.",

        "abstract": "Introduction We mapped available evidence on performance measurement and management (PMM) strategies in primary healthcare (PHC) systems of low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Widely used, their effectiveness remains inconclusive. This evidence gap map characterises existing research and evidence gaps. Methods Systematic mapping of performance measurement and management research in LMICs from 2000 to mid-2018; literature searches of seven academic databases and institutional repositories of impact evaluations and systematic reviews. Using a combination of manual screening and machine learning, four reviewers appraised 38 088 titles and abstracts, and extracted metadata from 137 impact evaluations and 18 systematic reviews that met the inclusion criteria. The resulting visual representation of the evidence base was uploaded to a web-based platform. Results Since 2000, the number of studies has increased; the first systematic reviews were completed in 2010. Two-thirds of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Randomised controlled trials were the most frequently used study design. The evidence is concentrated in two types of PMM strategies: implementation strategies (in-service training, continuing education, supervision) and performance-based financing. Major gaps exist in accountability arrangements particularly the use of audit and feedback. The least studied types of outcomes were unintended effects, harm and social equity. Conclusions The evidence is clustered around interventions that are unlikely to achieve transformational change in health outcomes. The gaps identified suggest that routinely used PMM strategies are implemented without sufficient knowledge of their effects. Future efforts at redesigning PHC systems need to be informed by evidence on the most effective approaches for using PMM strategies.",

        "abstract": "Cloud computing is the most recent smart city advancement, made possible by the increasing volume of heterogeneous data produced by apps. More storage capacity and processing power are required to process this volume of data. Data analytics is used to examine various datasets, both structured and unstructured. Nonetheless, as the complexity of data in the healthcare and biomedical communities grows, obtaining more precise results from analyses of medical datasets presents a number of challenges. In the cloud environment, big data is abundant, necessitating proper classification that can be effectively divided using machine language. Machine learning is used to investigate algorithms for learning and data prediction. The Cleveland database is frequently used by machine learning researchers. Among the performance metrics used to compare the proposed and existing methodologies are execution time, defect detection rate, and accuracy. In this study, two supervised learning-based classifiers, SVM and Novel KNN, were proposed and used to analyses data from a benchmark database obtained from the UCI repository. Initially, intrusions were detected using the SVM classification method. The proposed study demonstrated how the novel KNN used for distance capacity outperformed previous studies. The accuracy of the results of both approaches is evaluated. The results show that the intrusion detection system (IDS) with a 98.98% accuracy rate produces the best results when using the suggested system.",

In recent years, due to the extensive growth rate in mental disorders, it is essential to better understand the inadequate outcomes from mental health problems. Mental health research is challenging given the perceived limitations of ethical principles such as the protection of autonomy, consent, threat, and damage. In this survey, we aimed to investigate studies where big data approaches were used in mental illness and treatment. Firstly, different types of mental illness, for instance, bipolar disorder, depression, and personality disorders, are discussed. The effects of mental health on user’s behavior such as suicide and drug addiction are highlighted. A description of the methodologies and tools is presented to predict the mental condition of the patient under the supervision of artificial intelligence and machine learning.",

        "abstract": "Although machine learning has become a powerful tool to augment doctors in clinical analysis, the immense amount of labeled data that is necessary to train supervised learning approaches burdens each development task as time and resource intensive. The vast majority of dense clinical information is stored in written reports, detailing pertinent patient information. The challenge with utilizing natural language data for standard model development is due to the complex and unstructured nature of the modality. In this research, a model pipeline was developed to utilize an unsupervised approach to train a language model, a bidirectional recurrent neural network, to generate document encodings; which then can be used as features passed into a classifier model that requires magnitudes less labeled data than previous approaches to differentiate between fine-grained disease classes accurately. The language model was trained on raw clinical reports from the Partner's Healthcare database $(\\mathrm{n}=218,159)$ and terminated with a loss of 1.62 and a word prediction accuracy of 62%. The classification models were trained on three labeled datasets, occlusion $(\\mathrm{n}=1403)$, stroke $(\\mathrm{n}=331)$, and hemorrhage $(\\mathrm{n}=4350)$, to identify a variety of different occlusions, stroke, and hemorrhages, directly from the clinical report data; resulting in AUCs of 0.98, 0.95, and 0.99, respectively, for the occlusion, stroke, and hemorrhage datasets. The output encodings are able to be used in conjunction with images or waveform data, to create models that can process a multitude of different modalities. The ability to automatically extract relevant features from textual data allows for faster model development and integration of textual modality, overall, allowing clinical reports to become a more viable input for more encompassing and accurate deep learning models.",

        "abstract": "Humans interact with the environment using a combination of perception - transforming sensory inputs from their environment into symbols, and cognition - mapping symbols to knowledge about the environment for supporting abstraction, reasoning by analogy, and long-term planning. Human perception-inspired machine perception, in the context of AI, refers to large-scale pattern recognition from raw data using neural networks trained using self-supervised learning objectives such as next-word prediction or object recognition. On the other hand, machine cognition encompasses more complex computations, such as using knowledge of the environment to guide reasoning, analogy, and long-term planning. Humans can also control and explain their cognitive functions. This seems to require the retention of symbolic mappings from perception outputs to knowledge about their environment. For example, humans can follow and explain the guidelines and safety constraints driving their decision-making in safety-critical applications such as healthcare, criminal justice, and autonomous driving. This article introduces the rapidly emerging paradigm of Neurosymbolic AI combines neural networks and knowledge-guided symbolic approaches to create more capable and flexible AI systems.

        "abstract": "Clinical prognostic models derived from largescale healthcare data can inform critical diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. To enable off-theshelf usage of machine learning (ML) in prognostic research, we developed AUTOPROGNOSIS: a system for automating the design of predictive modeling pipelines tailored for clinical prognosis. AUTOPROGNOSIS optimizes ensembles of pipeline configurations efficiently using a novel batched Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm that learns a low-dimensional decomposition of the pipelines high-dimensional hyperparameter space in concurrence with the BO procedure. This is achieved by modeling the pipelines performances as a black-box function with a Gaussian process prior, and modeling the similarities between the pipelines baseline algorithms via a sparse additive kernel with a Dirichlet prior. Meta-learning is used to warmstart BO with external data from similar patient cohorts by calibrating the priors using an algorithm that mimics the empirical Bayes method. The system automatically explains its predictions by presenting the clinicians with logical association rules that link patients features to predicted risk strata. We demonstrate the utility of AUTOPROGNOSIS using 10 major patient cohorts representing various aspects of cardiovascular patient care.",

        "abstract": "Model evaluation plays a special role in interactive machine learning (IML) systems in which users rely on their assessment of a model's performance in order to determine how to improve it. A better understanding of what model criteria are important to users can therefore inform the design of user interfaces for model evaluation as well as the choice and design of learning algorithms. We present work studying the evaluation practices of end users interactively building supervised learning systems for real-world gesture analysis problems. We examine users' model evaluation criteria, which span conventionally relevant criteria such as accuracy and cost, as well as novel criteria such as unexpectedness. We observed that users employed evaluation techniques---including cross-validation and direct, real-time evaluation---not only to make relevant judgments of algorithms' performance and interactively improve the trained models, but also to learn to provide more effective training data. Furthermore, we observed that evaluation taught users about what types of models were easy or possible to build, and users sometimes used this information to modify the learning problem definition or their plans for using the trained models in practice. We discuss the implications of these findings with regard to the role of generalization accuracy in IML, the design of new algorithms and interfaces, and the scope of potential benefits of incorporating human interaction in the design of supervised learning systems.",

The role of emerging technologies like AI, ML, Deep Learning, IoT and Robotics is gaining importance in handling such data using various algorithms. Each of these algorithms has a large number of applications in the healthcare domain, including decision on appropriate treatment journeys, analysis of medical reports, making informed clinical decisions, assistance in operational tasks at hospitals, tracking of vital signs, detection of diseases at an early stage and so on. Usage of such technologies introduces a level of automation in these medical procedures. Data can be accessed and analysed accurately and quickly. This also gives more time to health care professionals for patient care. However, it should be ensured that human supervision is maintained, so as to avoid any unexpected risk to patients. Also, human interaction and empathy is necessary for a patient's well-being and thus, not all medical processes should be performed by machines alone.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective and safe medical procedure that mainly indicated for depression, but is also indicated for patients with other conditions. However, ECT is among the most stigmatized and controversial treatments in medicine. Our objective was to examine social media contents on Twitter related to ECT to identify and evaluate public views on the matter. Methods We collected Twitter posts in English and Spanish mentioning ECT between January 1, 2019 and October 31, 2020. Identified tweets were subject to a mixed method quantitative–qualitative content and sentiment analysis combining manual and semi-supervised natural language processing machine-learning analyses. Such analyses identified the distribution of tweets, their public interest (retweets and likes per tweet), and sentiment for the observed different categories of Twitter users and contents. Results “Healthcare providers” users produced more tweets (25%) than “people with lived experience” and their “relatives” (including family members and close friends or acquaintances) (10% combined), and were the main publishers of “medical” content (mostly related to ECT’s main indications). However, more than half of the total tweets had “joke or trivializing” contents, and such had a higher like and retweet ratio. Among those tweets manifesting personal opinions on ECT, around 75% of them had a negative sentiment. Conclusions Mixed method analysis of social media contents on Twitter offers a novel perspective to examine public opinion on ECT, and our results show attitudes more negative than those reflected in studies using surveys and other traditional methods.",

        "title": "Augmented Risk Prediction for the Onset of Alzheimer's Disease from Electronic Health Records with Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans aged 65 and older. Screening and early detection of AD and related dementias (ADRD) are critical for timely intervention and for identifying clinical trial participants. The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) offers an important resource for developing ADRD screening tools such as machine learning based predictive models. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their unprecedented capability of encoding knowledge and performing reasoning, which offers them strong potential for enhancing risk prediction. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that augments risk prediction by leveraging the few-shot inference power of LLMs to make predictions on cases where traditional supervised learning methods (SLs) may not excel. Specifically, we develop a collaborative pipeline that combines SLs and LLMs via a confidence-driven decision-making mechanism, leveraging the strengths of SLs in clear-cut cases and LLMs in more complex scenarios. We evaluate this pipeline using a real-world EHR data warehouse from Oregon Health \\&Science University (OHSU) Hospital, encompassing EHRs from over 2.5 million patients and more than 20 million patient encounters. Our results show that our proposed approach effectively combines the power of SLs and LLMs, offering significant improvements in predictive performance. This advancement holds promise for revolutionizing ADRD screening and early detection practices, with potential implications for better strategies of patient management and thus improving healthcare.",

This collaborative process occurs under the supervision of a central server orchestrating the training or via a peer-to-peer network. The significance of FL is particularly pronounced in industries such as healthcare and finance, where data privacy holds paramount importance. However, training a model under the Federated learning setting brings forth several challenges, with one of the most prominent being the heterogeneity of data distribution among the edge devices. The data is typically non-independently and non-identically distributed (non-IID), thereby presenting challenges to model convergence. This report delves into the issues arising from non-IID and heterogeneous data and explores current algorithms designed to address these challenges.",

        "title": "Large Language Models for Patient Comments Multi-Label Classification",
        "abstract": "Patient experience and care quality are crucial for a hospital's sustainability and reputation. The analysis of patient feedback offers valuable insight into patient satisfaction and outcomes. However, the unstructured nature of these comments poses challenges for traditional machine learning methods following a supervised learning paradigm. This is due to the unavailability of labeled data and the nuances these texts encompass. This research explores leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in conducting Multi-label Text Classification (MLTC) of inpatient comments shared after a stay in the hospital. GPT-4 Turbo was leveraged to conduct the classification. However, given the sensitive nature of patients' comments, a security layer is introduced before feeding the data to the LLM through a Protected Health Information (PHI) detection framework, which ensures patients' de-identification. Additionally, using the prompt engineering framework, zero-shot learning, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought prompting were experimented with. Results demonstrate that GPT-4 Turbo, whether following a zero-shot or few-shot setting, outperforms traditional methods and Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and achieves the highest overall performance with an F1-score of 76.12% and a weighted F1-score of 73.61% followed closely by the few-shot learning results. Subsequently, the results' association with other patient experience structured variables (e.g., rating) was conducted. The study enhances MLTC through the application of LLMs, offering healthcare practitioners an efficient method to gain deeper insights into patient feedback and deliver prompt, appropriate responses.",

        "title": "Privacy Protected Medical Data Classification in precision medicine using an Ontology-based Support Vector Machine in the Diabetes Management System",
        "abstract": "Diabetes is a serious health issue across the globe. As stated by the International Diabetes Foundation, currently 425 million people live with diabetes globally, and another 300 million people are expecting to be at higher risk of diabetes in the year 2030.Hence, there is an urgent clinical need for an early prognosis, diagnosis, and management of diabetes and its complications. In this context, numerous intelligent machine learning and data mining approaches including Support vector machine (SVM) have been exploited for diabetes management.SVM is a prevailing supervised and discriminative data classifier which assists the healthcare and biomedical professionals to ascertain unknown data patterns by training a large volume of real-time data. Since this database is the private asset, the sensitive information should be safeguarded without compromising the utility. Even though SVM is a fast and accurate machine learning technique, it does not have the capacity to represent semantically the classification and reasoning rules which can enable more precise classification. Therefore, the objective of this research is three-fold. Firstly, in order to protect sensitive clinical data, we introduce the Kronecker product and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) based coefficient generation technique. Secondly, we design diabetes ontology to define domain concepts and relationships and allow medical datamining. Finally, we implement the Ontology-based Support Vector Machine (Ont-SVM) classifier by assimilating privacy protection, ontology, and SVM-based classifier for the diagnosis of diabetes.The experimental results on a real-world dataset, the Pima Indian database at the UCI repository, illustrate that the proposed Ont-SVM outperforms other existing approaches in terms of privacy, accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, supervised machine learning models have demonstrated tremendous success in a variety of application domains. Despite the promising results, these successful models are data hungry and their performance relies heavily on the size of training data. However, in many healthcare applications it is difficult to collect sufficiently large training datasets. Transfer learning can help overcome this issue by transferring the knowledge from readily available datasets (source) to a new dataset (target). In this work, we propose a hybrid instance-based transfer learning method that outperforms a set of baselines including state-of-the-art instance-based transfer learning approaches. Our method uses a probabilistic weighting strategy to fuse information from the source domain to the model learned in the target domain. Our method is generic, applicable to multiple source domains, and robust with respect to negative transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments for two different applications.",

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning has attracted a significant amount of attention in pattern recognition and machine learning. Most previous studies have focused on designing special algorithms to effectively exploit the unlabeled data in conjunction with labeled data. Our goal is to improve the classification accuracy of any given supervised learning algorithm by using the available unlabeled examples. We call this as the Semi-supervised improvement problem, to distinguish the proposed approach from the existing approaches. We design a metasemi-supervised learning algorithm that wraps around the underlying supervised algorithm and improves its performance using unlabeled data. This problem is particularly important when we need to train a supervised learning algorithm with a limited number of labeled examples and a multitude of unlabeled examples. We present a boosting framework for semi-supervised learning, termed as SemiBoost. The key advantages of the proposed semi-supervised learning approach are: 1) performance improvement of any supervised learning algorithm with a multitude of unlabeled data, 2) efficient computation by the iterative boosting algorithm, and 3) exploiting both manifold and cluster assumption in training classification models. An empirical study on 16 different data sets and text categorization demonstrates that the proposed framework improves the performance of several commonly used supervised learning algorithms, given a large number of unlabeled examples. We also show that the performance of the proposed algorithm, SemiBoost, is comparable to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms.",

        "title": "Developing a data-driven predictive model for substance abuse prevention among youth using behavioral analytics",
        "abstract": "Substance abuse among youth presents a critical public health challenge, necessitating innovative approaches for early intervention and prevention. This study proposes the development of a data-driven predictive model that leverages behavioral analytics to identify youth at risk of substance abuse. The model utilizes data from multiple sources, including social media activity, school performance records, and mental health screenings, to analyze behavioral patterns that may indicate a predisposition toward substance misuse. The core methodology integrates machine learning algorithms to process and analyze large datasets, uncovering correlations between specific behaviors and the likelihood of substance abuse. Predictive features such as changes in social engagement, academic performance fluctuations, and indicators of emotional distress are identified and incorporated into the model to enhance its accuracy. By applying supervised learning techniques, the model is trained to recognize patterns in historical data, allowing it to make predictions about future substance use risks. Furthermore, the model's design emphasizes real-time monitoring and adaptability, enabling health professionals and educators to receive timely alerts and intervene early when behavioral warning signs are detected. The application of behavioral analytics in this context offers a more proactive, personalized approach to prevention, targeting at-risk individuals before they develop harmful substance use habits. In addition to its predictive capabilities, the model also provides actionable insights into effective intervention strategies. By identifying the most influential behavioral factors, it informs tailored prevention programs that address specific risk behaviors among youth. These findings can support policymakers and healthcare providers in developing data-driven, evidence-based prevention initiatives that better allocate resources to high-risk populations.",

        "title": "Using clinical text to refine unspecific condition codes in Dutch general practitioner EHR data",
        "abstract": "Objective: Observational studies using electronic health record (EHR) databases often face challenges due to unspecific clinical codes that can obscure detailed medical information, hindering precise data analysis. In this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of refining these unspecific condition codes into more specific codes in a Dutch general practitioner (GP) EHR database by leveraging the available clinical free text. Methods: We utilized three approaches for text classification-search queries, semi-supervised learning, and supervised learning-to improve the specificity of ten unspecific International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-1) codes. Two text representations and three machine learning algorithms were evaluated for the (semi-)supervised models. Additionally, we measured the improvement achieved by the refinement process on all code occurrences in the database. Results: The classification models performed well for most codes. In general, no single classification approach consistently outperformed the others. However, there were variations in the relative performance of the classification approaches within each code and in the use of different text representations and machine learning algorithms. Class imbalance and limited training data affected the performance of the (semi-)supervised models, yet the simple search queries remained particularly effective. Ultimately, the developed models improved the specificity of over half of all the unspecific code occurrences in the database. Conclusions: Our findings show the feasibility of using information from clinical text to improve the specificity of unspecific condition codes in observational healthcare databases, even with a limited range of machine-learning techniques and modest annotated training sets. Future work could investigate transfer learning, integration of structured data, alternative semi-supervised methods, and validation of models across healthcare settings. The improved level of detail enriches the interpretation of medical information and can benefit observational research and patient care.",

        "abstract": "Blood group identification is crucial for safe medical procedures, but traditional techniques are based on invasive blood draws, which are risky and inconvenient. This research presents a new, non-invasive method to identify ABO and Rh blood groups from fingerprints. By taking advantage of the biochemical residues in fingerprint sweat, which include blood group-specific antigens, we integrate Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and machine learning to identify blood groups. 200 participants with known blood groups provided spectroscopic analysis fingerprint samples to distinguish spectral biomarkers. Supervised learning algorithms based on support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) were then trained to align spectral patterns against blood group antigens. A total accuracy rate of 94.5% was achieved through the suggested methodology, with the precision rate crossing 92% for ABO group discrimination and 96% for Rh factor classification. Comparative verification established its reliability over conventional serological tests. Environmental contamination and inter-individual variability of sweat were overcome with sophisticated preprocessing and feature selection. This non-invasive method exhibits great promise for rapid, cost-efficient blood group screening in clinical, forensic, and resource-scarce contexts. By fusing biometric and biochemical information, this study opens the way for portable, fingerprint-based diagnostic devices, maximizing patient comfort and operational effectiveness within healthcare systems\n\n\nKeywords— Fingerprint recognition, Blood group\n\n identification, Pattern recognition, Image processing\n\n,Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Healthcare\n\n\ntechnology, Medical diagnostics, Personalized medicine, Fingerprint analysis, Vein pattern recognition, Dermatoglyphics, Biometric authentication, Health informatics",

        "abstract": "The research paper shows how AI's application improves the correctness of diagnosis and increases the rate of accomplishing multiple tasks, including when it comes across some hurdles, such as AI-based digital diagnosis algorithms. In the past, AI was used exclusively to process data, work as an analyzing tool for medical images in health information systems, and assist in decision-making. Still, the process often involves deep machine learning. This is an independent work based on the outcome of other research, which indicates that AI increases bias and needs interaction with people.AI has certain privileges over traditional methods, time and again, relating to swift analysis and comprehensive data assimilation. The patient feedback tells us that despite the preference for AI-generated diagnostic hints, people still want a human professional's supervision or confirmation concerning the results achieved in this sphere, which indicates the directions for the further enhancement of AI utilization in healthcare. These comments emphasize the need to continue improving research and development to address concerns regarding data quality, algorithms' explanations, and ethical problems.",

        "abstract": "The technology for human activity recognition has become an active research topic in recent years as it has many potential applications, such as surveillance systems, healthcare systems, and human-computer interaction. In the research of activity recognition, supervised machine learning approaches have been widely used for activity recognition. However, the cost of collecting labeled sensor data in new environments is high. Furthermore, these methods do not work well in a cross-domain environment using conventional machine learning approaches. In this study, we proposed a transfer learning framework based on principal component analysis (PCA) transformation, Gale– Shapley similarity measurement, and Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) feature mapping. Transfer learning aims to apply new information learned from the source domain to the target domain. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach performs better than the approach merely learned in the source environment. this study, we proposed a transfer learning framework to overcome these problems. The proposed framework consists of three steps: (1) extract seminal information from the source and target environments with principal component analysis (PCA) transformation, (2) measure the feature similarity with the Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) algorithm, and (3) map features to a common space based on the Gale–Shapley algorithm. The proposed transfer framework can be used to increase the recognition performance when the model is applied to a new environment where the training sample is insufficient. In addition, it can also reduce the effort of obtaining labeling data.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is a significant global healthcare challenge, particularly in developing and underdeveloped countries, with profound physical, emotional, and psychological consequences, including mortality. Timely diagnosis and accurate treatment are crucial in addressing this issue. We propose the utilization of a feature selection technique to identify the most relevant features from among all features for breast cancer diagnosis, and show that Genetic Algorithms are impressive for this task. The study compares the results of GA with no selection and an alternative method, Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Three machine learning models, all based on supervised learning with data split into training and test data, are employed for binary classification using the selected feature subset. The evaluation metrics employed encompass accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among the selected models, Random Forest demonstrates the most favorable outcomes, achieving an accuracy score of 0.96, precision score of 0.96, recall value of 0.98, and an F1-score of 0.97. These results underscore the effectiveness of GA in feature selection for breast cancer diagnosis. Consequently, the integration of Genetic Algorithms (GA) with Random Forest showcases the superior performance among the evaluated models.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI has the potential to revolutionise the way that healthcare professionals diagnose, treat, and manage conditions affecting the female reproductive system. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI which deals with the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of ML that utilises neural networks with multiple layers, known as deep neural networks (DNNs), to learn from data. DNNs are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and are capable of automatically learning highlevel features from raw data, such as images, audio and text. DL has been very successful in various applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing and computer vision. ML algorithms can be divided into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning algorithms are trained on a labelled dataset, where the desired output (label) is already known. Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained on an unlabelled dataset and are used to discover patterns or relationships in the data. Reinforcement learning algorithms are trained using a trialanderror approach, where the agent receives a reward or penalty for its actions. The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn a policy that maximises the expected reward over time. AI and ML are increasingly being applied in the field of obstetrics and gynaecology, with the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, patient outcomes, and efficiency of care.",

        "title": "Offenders and non-offenders with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: the crime-preventive potential of sufficient embedment in the mental healthcare and support system",
        "abstract": "Background Suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) has been well-established as a risk factor for offending. However, the majority of patients with an SSD do not show aggressive or criminal behavior. Yet, there is little research on clinical key features distinguishing offender from non-offender patients. Previous results point to poorer impulse control, higher levels of excitement, tension, and hostility, and worse overall cognitive functioning in offender populations. This study aimed to detect the most indicative distinguishing clinical features between forensic and general psychiatric patients with SSD based on the course of illness and the referenced hospitalization in order to facilitate a better understanding of the relationship between violent and non-violent offenses and SSD. Methods Our study population consisted of forensic psychiatric patients (FPPs) with a diagnosis of F2x (ICD-10) or 295.x (ICD-9) and a control group of general psychiatric patients (GPPs) with the same diagnosis, totaling 740 patients. Patients were evaluated regarding their medical (and, if applicable, criminal) history and the referenced psychiatric hospitalization. Supervised machine learning (ML) was used to exploratively evaluate predictor variables and their interplay and rank them in accordance with their discriminative power. Results Out of 194 possible predictor variables, the following 6 turned out to have the highest influence on the model: olanzapine equivalent at discharge from the referenced hospitalization, a history of antipsychotic prescription, a history of antidepressant, benzodiazepine or mood stabilizer prescription, medication compliance, outpatient treatment(s) in the past, and the necessity of compulsory measures. Out of the seven algorithms applied, gradient boosting emerged as the most suitable, with an AUC of 0.86 and a balanced accuracy of 77.5%. Discussion Our study aimed to identify the most influential illness-related predictors, distinguishing between FPP and GPP with SSD, thus shedding light on key differences between the two groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare a homogenous sample of FPP and GPP with SSD regarding their symptom severity and course of illness using highly sophisticated statistical approaches with the possibility of evaluating the interplay of all factors at play.",

        "title": "Domain Adaptation Methods for Lab-to-Field Human Context Recognition",
        "abstract": "Human context recognition (HCR) using sensor data is a crucial task in Context-Aware (CA) applications in domains such as healthcare and security. Supervised machine learning HCR models are trained using smartphone HCR datasets that are scripted or gathered in-the-wild. Scripted datasets are most accurate because of their consistent visit patterns. Supervised machine learning HCR models perform well on scripted datasets but poorly on realistic data. In-the-wild datasets are more realistic, but cause HCR models to perform worse due to data imbalance, missing or incorrect labels, and a wide variety of phone placements and device types. Lab-to-field approaches learn a robust data representation from a scripted, high-fidelity dataset, which is then used for enhancing performance on a noisy, in-the-wild dataset with similar labels. This research introduces Triplet-based Domain Adaptation for Context REcognition (Triple-DARE), a lab-to-field neural network method that combines three unique loss functions to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separation within the embedding space of multi-labeled datasets: (1) domain alignment loss in order to learn domain-invariant embeddings; (2) classification loss to preserve task-discriminative features; and (3) joint fusion triplet loss. Rigorous evaluations showed that Triple-DARE achieved 6.3% and 4.5% higher F1-score and classification, respectively, than state-of-the-art HCR baselines and outperformed non-adaptive HCR models by 44.6% and 10.7%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In traditional treatments of breast cancer patients, people get the similar treatment that means it follows a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Over a while, doctors have noticed that some treatments have given better results for some people than others. Everyone has their own unique identifying features, and so the treatment to the individual patients also needs to be tailor made. Personalized medicine (PM) for breast cancer considers individual differences in people’s lifestyle, surroundings, and genetics, and it provides medicos with the information they need to target disease specific treatments. (ML)Machine learning plays an important role in personalized medicine (PM). It uses computational algorithms to analyze large amounts of data from different input sources such as medical records, molecular, genetic information, and data from clinical trials for finding patterns and predict outcomes. This information can then be used to tailor treatments specifically to an individual’s characteristics and assist doctor in finding risk of disease and finding optimal treatments. The paper discusses about application of supervised machine learning (ML)algorithm: Random Forest algorithms for classification of three treatments of breast cancer patients namely chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and amputation.",

This is often inefficient even with recent advances in the efficient training of the (supervised) SVM. In this paper, we show that S3VMs, with knowledge of the means of the class labels of the unlabeled data, is closely related to the supervised SVM with known labels on all the unlabeled data. This motivates us to first estimate the label means of the unlabeled data. Two versions of the meanS3VM, which work by maximizing the margin between the label means, are proposed. The first one is based on multiple kernel learning, while the second one is based on alternating optimization. Experiments show that both of the proposed algorithms achieve highly competitive and sometimes even the best performance as compared to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learners. Moreover, they are more efficient than existing S3VMs.",

Although the primary navigation mode is system-initiated, many users attempt to take initiative by expressing various intents with natural language messages. This paper describes a multi-lingual corpus of those initiative attempts manually annotated with intent labels as well as results of modeling experiments on the classification of these intents using context-dependent supervised machine learning.",

        "abstract": "Image document classification is crucial in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and security. Automatically categorizing images into predefined classes can significantly improve data management and decision-making processes. For this research, we investigate the effectiveness of two machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gradient Boosting, for image document classification. First, we preprocess the image data by extracting relevant features, such as Image Embedding, to create a feature vector for each image. These features are essential for representing the content of the images accurately. Next, we apply SVM, a robust supervised learning algorithm, to train a classification model. SVM aims to Determine the optimal hyperplane for effectively distinguishing the images into different classes while maximizing the margin. Furthermore, we explore the Gradient Boosting algorithm, an ensemble learning method combining multiple weak learners to create a robust classifier. We experimented with different classification results with ten classes. We employ Multiple measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, are used to assess the performance of the SVM and Gradient Boosting models. The higher result of 0.964 for SVM compared with Adaboost is achieved. 0.853. ",

        "title": "Automatic inference of hypoglycemia causes in type 1 diabetes: a feasibility study",
        "abstract": "Background Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse consequence of treating diabetes, and is often due to suboptimal patient self-care. Behavioral interventions by health professionals and self-care education helps avoid recurrent hypoglycemic episodes by targeting problematic patient behaviors. This relies on time-consuming investigation of reasons behind the observed episodes, which involves manual interpretation of personal diabetes diaries and communication with patients. Therefore, there is a clear motivation to automate this process using a supervised machine learning paradigm. This manuscript presents a feasibility study of automatic identification of hypoglycemia causes. Methods Reasons for 1885 hypoglycemia events were labeled by 54 participants with type 1 diabetes over a 21 months period. A broad range of possible predictors were extracted describing a hypoglycemic episode and the subject’s general self-care from participants’ routinely collected data on the Glucollector, their diabetes management platform. Thereafter, the possible hypoglycemia reasons were categorized for two major analysis sections - statistical analysis of relationships between the data features of self-care and hypoglycemia reasons, and classification analysis investigating the design of an automated system to determine the reason for hypoglycemia. Results Physical activity contributed to 45% of hypoglycemia reasons on the real world collected data. The statistical analysis provided a number of interpretable predictors of different hypoglycemia reasons based on self-care behaviors. The classification analysis showed the performance of a reasoning system in practical settings with different objectives under F1-score, recall and precision metrics. Conclusion The data acquisition characterized the incidence distribution of the various hypoglycemia reasons. The analyses highlighted many interpretable predictors of the various hypoglycemia types. Also, the feasibility study presented a number of concerns valuable in the design of the decision support system for automatic hypoglycemia reason classification. Therefore, automating the identification of the causes of hypoglycemia may help objectively to target behavioral and therapeutic changes in patients' care.",

        "title": "Investigating Beta-Variational Convolutional Autoencoders for the Unsupervised Classification of Chest Pneumonia",
        "abstract": "The world’s population is increasing and so is the challenge on existing healthcare infrastructure to cope with the growing demand in medical diagnosis and evaluation. Although human experts are primarily tasked with the diagnosis of different medical conditions, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnoses have become considerably useful in recent times. One of the critical lung infections, which requires early diagnosis and subsequent treatment to reduce the mortality rate, is pneumonia. There are different methods for obtaining a pneumonia diagnosis; however, the adoption of chest X-rays is popular since it is non-invasive. The AI systems for a pneumonia diagnosis using chest X-rays are often built on supervised machine-learning (ML) models, which require labeled datasets for development. However, collecting labeled datasets is sometimes infeasible due to constraints such as human resources, cost, and time. As such, the problem that we address in this paper is the unsupervised classification of pneumonia using unsupervised ML models including the beta-variational convolutional autoencoder (β-VCAE) and other variants, such as convolutional autoencoders (CAE), denoising convolutional autoencoders (DCAE), and sparse convolutional autoencoders (SCAE). Namely, the pneumonia classification problem is cast into an anomaly detection to develop the aforementioned ML models. The experimental results show that pneumonia can be diagnosed with high recall, precision, f1-score, and f2-score using the proposed unsupervised models. In addition, we observe that the proposed models are competitive with the state-of-the-art models, which are trained on a labeled dataset.",

        "title": "Comparison of Performance of Classification Algorithms Using Standard Deviation-based Feature Selection in Cyber Attack Datasets",
        "abstract": "Supervised machine learning techniques are commonly used in many areas like finance, education, healthcare, engineering, etc. because of their ability to learn from past data. However, such techniques can be very slow if the dataset is high-dimensional, and also irrelevant features may reduce classification success. Therefore, feature selection or feature reduction techniques are commonly used to overcome the mentioned issues. On the other hand, information security for both people and networks is crucial, and it must be secured without wasting the time. Hence, feature selection approaches that can make the algorithms faster without reducing the classification success are needed. In this study, we compare both the classification success and run-time performance of state-of-the-art classification algorithms using standard deviation-based feature selection in the aspect of security datasets. For this purpose, we applied standard deviation-based feature selection to KDD Cup 99 and Phishing Legitimate datasets for selecting the most relevant features, and then we run the selected classification algorithms on the datasets to compare the results. According to the obtained results, while the classification success of all algorithms is satisfying Decision Tree (DT) was the best one among others. On the other hand, while Decision Tree, k Nearest Neighbors, and Naïve Bayes (BN) were sufficiently fast, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN or NN) were too slow.",

        "abstract": "Malaysia has reported no indigenous cases of P. falciparum and P. vivax for over 3 years. When transmission reaches such low levels, it is important to understand the individuals and locations where exposure risks are high, as they may be at greater risk in the case of a resurgence of transmission. Serology is a useful tool in low transmission settings, providing insight into exposure over longer durations than PCR or RDT. We ran blood samples from a 2015 population-based survey in northern Sabah, Malaysian Borneo on a multiplex bead assay. Using supervised machine learning methods, we characterised recent and historic exposure to Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax and found recent exposure to P. falciparum to be very low, with exposure to both species increasing with age. We performed a risk-factor assessment on environmental, behavioural, demographic and household factors, and identified forest activity and longer travel times to healthcare as common risk-factors for exposure to P. falciparum and P. vivax. In addition, we used remote-sensing derived data and geostatistical models to assess environmental and spatial associations with exposure. We created predictive maps of exposure to recent P. falciparum in the study area and showed 3 clear foci of exposure. This study provides useful insight into the environmental, spatial and demographic risk factors for P. falciparum and P. vivax at a period of low transmission in Malaysian Borneo. The findings would be valuable in the case of resurgence of human malarias in the region.",

However, there has been limited exploration of explainable AI techniques on time-series data, especially in the healthcare context. In this paper, we describe a threshold-based method that utilizes a weakly supervised model and a gradient-based explainable AI technique (i.e. saliency map) and explore its feasibility to identify salient frames of time-series data. Using the dataset from 15 post-stroke survivors performing three upper-limb exercises and labels on whether a compensatory motion is observed or not, we implemented a feed-forward neural network model and utilized gradients of each input on model outcomes to identify salient frames that involve compensatory motions. According to the evaluation using frame-level annotations, our approach achieved a recall of 0.96 and an F2-score of 0.91. Our results demonstrated the potential of a gradient-based explainable AI technique (e.g. saliency map) for time-series data, such as highlighting the frames of a video that therapists should focus on reviewing and reducing the efforts on frame-level labeling for model training.",

        "title": "A Web-scrapped Skin Image Database of Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Smallpox, Cowpox, and Measles",
        "abstract": "Monkeypox has emerged as a fast-spreading disease around the world and an outbreak has been reported in 42 countries so far. Although the clinical attributes of Monkeypox are similar to that of Smallpox, skin lesions and rashes caused by Monkeypox often resemble that of other pox types, e.g., Chickenpox and Cowpox. This scenario makes an early diagnosis of Monkeypox challenging for the healthcare professional just by observing the visual appearance of lesions and rashes. The rarity of Monkeypox before the current outbreak further created a knowledge gap among healthcare professionals around the world. To tackle this challenging situation, scientists are taking motivation from the success of supervised machine learning in COVID-19 detection. However, the lack of Monkeypox skin image data is making the bottleneck of using machine learning in Monkeypox detection from skin images of patients. Therefore, in this project, we introduce the Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset (MSID), the largest of its kind so far. We used web-scrapping to collect Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Smallpox, Cowpox and Measles infected skin as well as healthy skin images to build a comprehensive image database and made it publicly available. We believe that our database will facilitate the development of baseline machine learning algorithms for early Monkeypox detection in clinical settings. Our dataset is available at the following Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arafathussain/monkeypox-skin-image-dataset-2022.",

        "abstract": "Due to its advantages in numerous industries, including healthcare, sports, rehabilitation, and wearable electronics, gender recognition has garnered a lot of attention in the last ten years. The gender recognition method described in this study uses a wearable sensor device with inertial measurement units to record a variety of activities. The system consists of five sensors that are mounted to the upper and lower bodies while performing seven standing, walking, and climbing exercises that are meant to replicate daily activity. To create a model for gender recognition, we carried out an extensive study based on supervised machine learning. This study identifies a collection of sensor locations and behaviours to better precisely classify gender. Gender classification based on single activity was performed using Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Maximum accuracy of 92.06% was gained using Random Forest Classifier for the sensor located at the ankle when walking. Multi-activity based gender classification outperformed former by achieving an accuracy of 94.13% using RFC. This was for the activity combination of Romberg test eyes open, Single leg stance eyes open and Staircase up and down.",

        "abstract": "Background People are conversing about bariatric surgery on social media, but little is known about the main themes being discussed. Objective To analyze discussions regarding bariatric surgery on social media platforms and to establish a cross-cultural comparison of posts geolocated in France and the United States. Methods Posts were retrieved between January 2015 and April 2021 from general, publicly accessed sites and health-related forums geolocated in both countries. After processing and cleaning the data, posts of patients and caregivers about bariatric surgery were identified using a supervised machine learning algorithm. Results The analysis dataset contained a total of 10,800 posts from 4,947 web users in France and 51,804 posts from 40,278 web users in the United States. In France, post-operative follow-up (n = 3,251, 30.1% of posts), healthcare pathways (n = 2,171, 20.1% of the posts), and complementary and alternative weight loss therapies (n = 1,652, 15.3% of the posts) were among the most discussed topics. In the United States, the experience with bariatric surgery (n = 11,138, 21.5% of the posts) and the role of physical activity and diet in weight-loss programs before surgery (n = 9,325, 18% of the posts) were among the most discussed topics. Conclusion Social media analysis provides a valuable toolset for clinicians to help them increase patient-centered care by integrating the patients’ and caregivers’ needs and concerns into the management of bariatric surgery.",

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence as an Emerging Tool for Cardiologists",
        "abstract": ": In the world of data, there is an urgent need to ﬁnd ways to extract knowledge and information for improving patient care. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is an emerging tool that has the potential to provide cardiologists with new insights and knowledge. The healthcare industry has already begun the digital transformation of vast reams of data (Big Data) that are generated in routine clinical practice. AI has the potential to make a signiﬁcant impact on healthcare by improving the efﬁciency of clinical care, providing personalized treatment, and identifying new disease biomarkers. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are AI techniques that utilize large datasets and computational power for analysis and decision making. There are three main ML techniques: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Another functional AI service that has been presented is natural language processing (NLP), and it is applicable for analyzing patient documentation. In this paper, the scope of AI workﬂow, the most often used algorithms, and their performance metrics are explained. Explainable artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI) has a prominent potential to be a useful tool for clinicians as it provides full transparency into an AI model’s decision-making process, but few applications have been reviewed. In this paper, the challenges and limitations of AI in cardiology are discussed in terms of ethical, methodological, and legal issues. Furthermore, the successful establishment of good practices toward the right development and deployment of automated ML-based systems will ensure a regulatory framework that can strengthen patients’ trust in AI/ML-based clinical decision support systems.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has transformed the way healthcare functions in the present scenario. In orthodontics, expert systems and machine learning have aided clinicians in making complex, multifactorial decisions. One such scenario is an extraction decision in a borderline case. Objective: The present in silico study was planned with the intention of building an AI model for extraction decisions in borderline orthodontic cases. Design: An observational analytical study. Setting: Department of Orthodontics, Hitkarini Dental College and Hospital, Madhya Pradesh Medical University, Jabalpur, India. Methods: An artificial neural network (ANN) model for extraction or non-extraction decisions in borderline orthodontic cases was constructed based on a supervised learning algorithm using the Python (version 3.9) Sci-Kit Learn library and feed-forward backpropagation method. Based on 40 borderline orthodontic cases, 20 experienced clinicians were asked to recommend extraction or non-extraction treatment. The decision of the orthodontist and the diagnostic records, including the selected extraoral and intra-oral features, model analysis and cephalometric analysis parameters, constituted the training dataset of AI. The built-in model was then tested using a testing dataset of 20 borderline cases. After running the model on the testing dataset, the accuracy, F1 score, precision and recall were calculated. Results: The present AI model showed an accuracy of 97.97% for extraction and non-extraction decision-making. The receiver operating curve (ROC) and cumulative accuracy profile showed a near-perfect model with precision, recall and F1 values of 0.80, 0.84 and 0.82 for non-extraction decisions and 0.90, 0.87 and 0.88 for extraction decisions. Limitation: As the present study was preliminary in nature, the dataset included was too small and population-specific. Conclusion: The present AI model gave accurate results in decision-making capabilities related to extraction and non-extraction treatment modalities in borderline orthodontic cases of the present population.",

        "abstract": "Multi-instance learning and semi-supervised learning are different branches of machine learning. The former attempts to learn from a training set consists of labeled bags each containing many unlabeled instances; the latter tries to exploit abundant unlabeled instances when learning with a small number of labeled examples. In this paper, we establish a bridge between these two branches by showing that multi-instance learning can be viewed as a special case of semi-supervised learning. Based on this recognition, we propose the MissSVM algorithm which addresses multi-instance learning using a special semi-supervised support vector machine. Experiments show that solving multi-instance problems from the view of semi-supervised learning is feasible, and the MissSVM algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art multi-instance learning algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disorders (CVD) are the key cause of mortality worldwide. One in three male premature deaths and one in five female premature deaths are thought to be attributable to Cardiovascular disorders. Early prediction of CVDs may help to attenuate the disease, potentially lowering death rates. The existence of cardiac disease can be predicted using machine learning approaches; however, the effectiveness of the classifiers may be enhanced by applying PCA, relief feature selection, and data transformation techniques. The objective of employing data transformation, PCA, and relief feature selection approaches is to enhance classifier performance and increase the interpretability and ability of classifiers to predict heart disease. Heart disease anticipating is a challenging problem in the field of healthcare. This uses popular supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms including k-NN, LR, DT, RF, SVM, and ANN to help healthcare practitioners and specialists easily identify the prevalence of heart-related illnesses in patients. In these trials, data transformation is achieved using PCA, normalized features, and relief techniques, and RF surpasses all other classifiers with a prediction accuracy of 90%, followed by ANN and DT with AUCs of 87% and 86%, respectively. SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers were shown to be lesser effective at predicting heart disease.",

        "abstract": "The healthcare industry is actively researching heart disease prediction to identify people who have a higher likelihood of developing this condition. Due to the increasing prevalence of heart disease, it is vital to accurately identify and treat people at risk for it. Machine learning-based techniques offer potential benefits in the early detection and prevention of heart disease, but developing such methods is a complex task. Many countries lack the necessary cardiovascular expertise, and there is a significant number of misdiagnosed cases. Accurate and efficient prediction of heart disease at an early stage is essential for managing and treating the condition effectively, and digital patient records can support clinical decision-making. The ultimate goal is to reduce the incidence and mortality rates associated with heart disease. In this research, several supervised machine-learning algorithms have been developed and compared for their effectiveness in predicting heart disease, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, KNN, and Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). Among these models, Logistic Regression has demonstrated an accuracy of 0.86 and precision of 0.90, making it a promising approach for heart disease prediction.",

This kind of system can effectively be used in healthcare to provide personalized recommendations to patients. In this paper, a recommendation model has been proposed that flags the users with the diseases that they may have based on analyzing their historical medicine order and recommends them with alternate related medicines and products. The proposed model is based on a machine learning technique that takes into consideration the user’s medical history, disease diagnosis, and prescription orders and recommends other related medicine and products. The proposed model uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. A sizable dataset of patient orders from a top pharmaceutical retailer served as the basis for training and validating the model. The simulation results show that the model can handle complex situations, such as multiple medications and medical conditions, and predict medication recommendations with high accuracy.",

However, it is also known that concepts that are PAC-learnable with one-sided noise can be learned from MI data. A relevant question then is: how well do supervised learners do on MI data? We attempt to answer this question by looking at a cross section of MI data sets from various domains coupled with a number of learning algorithms including Diverse Density, Logistic Regression, nonlinear Support Vector Machines and FOIL. We consider a supervised and MI version of each learner. Several interesting conclusions emerge from our work: (1) no MI algorithm is superior across all tested domains, (2) some MI algorithms are consistently superior to their supervised counterparts, (3) using high false-positive costs can improve a supervised learner's performance in MI domains, and (4) in several domains, a supervised algorithm is superior to any MI algorithm we tested.",

We explore supervised and unsupervised kernel loss functions' impact on encoding circuit optimisation and evaluate them on diverse datasets for binary and multiple-class scenarios. Benchmarking against classical and quantum kernels reveals GA-generated circuits matching or surpassing standard techniques. We analyse the relationship between test accuracy and quantum kernel entropy, with results indicating a positive correlation.

In such a situation, how to enhance predictability of classification through unlabeled data is the focus. In this article, we introduce a novel large margin semi-supervised learning methodology, using grouping information from unlabeled data, together with the concept of margins, in a form of regularization controlling the interplay between labeled and unlabeled data. Based on this methodology, we develop two specific machines involving support vector machines and ψ-learning, denoted as SSVM and SPSI, through difference convex programming. In addition, we estimate the generalization error using both labeled and unlabeled data, for tuning regularizers. Finally, our theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that the proposed methodology achieves the desired objective of delivering high performance in generalization, particularly against some strong performers.",

However, current research on electroencephalogram (EEG) commonly assumed single model can be universally applied across all gender identities. While a few studies have identified gender differences through supervised classification of resting-state EEG, the majority have largely overlooked the potential impact of gender-specific differences in BCI applications. This study explored the gender-specific differences in motor imagery (MI) within BCIs and the feasibility of gender recognition in unsupervised settings. We utilized public datasets of male and female EEG signals, applied widely used machine learning algorithms for task and gender identification. The results showed that the average MI classification accuracy for female was 0.57% higher than male, despite the dataset containing more male subjects. In addition, gender recognition accuracy from EEG MI data exceeded 97%. These findings have highlighted the importance of considering gender-specific differences in BCI research and application. The results of this study could inform the development of more personalized effective BCIs in healthcare and other fields, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and experiences for users of all genders.",

        "title": "Fake It Till You Make It: Guidelines for Effective Synthetic Data Generation",
        "abstract": "Synthetic data provides a privacy protecting mechanism for the broad usage and sharing of healthcare data for secondary purposes. It is considered a safe approach for the sharing of sensitive data as it generates an artificial dataset that contains no identifiable information. Synthetic data is increasing in popularity with multiple synthetic data generators developed in the past decade, yet its utility is still a subject of research. This paper is concerned with evaluating the effect of various synthetic data generation and usage settings on the utility of the generated synthetic data and its derived models. Specifically, we investigate (i) the effect of data pre-processing on the utility of the synthetic data generated, (ii) whether tuning should be applied to the synthetic datasets when generating supervised machine learning models, and (iii) whether sharing preliminary machine learning results can improve the synthetic data models. Lastly, (iv) we investigate whether one utility measure (Propensity score) can predict the accuracy of the machine learning models generated from the synthetic data when employed in real life. We use two popular measures of synthetic data utility, propensity score and classification accuracy, to compare the different settings. We adopt a recent mechanism for the calculation of propensity, which looks carefully into the choice of model for the propensity score calculation. Accordingly, this paper takes a new direction with investigating the effect of various data generation and usage settings on the quality of the generated data and its ensuing models. The goal is to inform on the best strategies to follow when generating and using synthetic data.",

        "abstract": "— Classification and prediction of diseases is crucial in decision-making for the healthcare sectors, especially diabetes, a chronic disease. The availability and accessibility of diabetes datasets assists medical practitioners in the diagnosis process as well as researchers in various fields and these datasets are valuable sources. However, diabetes datasets are exposed to vagueness and uncertainty issues. This research work improved an interrelated decision-making model for diabetes by proposing a fuzzy rule-based model to handle the vagueness and uncertainty issues. The research methodology starts with pre-processing of the simulated diabetes diagnosis and level of care datasets that were validated by medical experts, as well as the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD). This is followed by the design of the fuzzy model and the construction of the fuzzy rules. Next, the testing of the fuzzy model using six supervised machine learning algorithms namely J48, Logistic, Naive Bayes Updateable, Random Tree, Bayes Net and AdaBoostM1. Lastly, the evaluation of the fuzzy model in terms of the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and confusion matrix. Experimental results show 100% accuracy for the diabetes diagnosis fuzzy model, for all the five machine learning algorithms mentioned except AdaBoostM1 with 79.8165% accuracy. In addition, for the level of care fuzzy model, the highest accuracy produced is 97.1098% for J48 algorithm and the lowest accuracy is 93.1049% for Naive Bayes Updateable and Bayes Net algorithms. Furthermore, for the PIDD fuzzy model, the highest accuracy obtained is 74.8698% for J48 and AdaBoostM1 algorithms and the lowest accuracy is 70.1823% for Random Tree algorithm. Overall, the proposed fuzzy model produced a good accuracy and working as expected associated to the previous interrelated decision-making model.",

One common approach involves contrasting semantically similar (positive) and dissimilar (negative) pairs of data points. Drawing negative samples uniformly from the training data set introduces false negatives, i.e., samples that are treated as dissimilar but belong to the same class. In healthcare data, the underlying class distribution is nonuniform, implying that false negatives occur at a highly variable rate. To improve the quality of learned representations, we develop a novel approach that corrects for false negatives. Our method can be viewed as a variant of debiased contrastive learning that uses estimated sample-specific class probabilities. We provide theoretical analysis of the objective function and demonstrate the proposed approach on both image and paired image-text data sets. Our experiments illustrate empirical advantages of sample-specific debiasing.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease stands as one of the most formidable health conditions worldwide, impacting a vast number of people globally. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid system that utilizes machine learning methods for identifying cardiac problems. Machine learning (ML) is extensively implemented in the medical industry worldwide, aiding in the prevention of heart conditions and locomotor disorders by analyzing extensive volumes of complex healthcare data. Our focus in this study revolves around identifying individuals with a higher likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease based on specific medical criteria. For this study, we utilized a 303-row, 14-property online UCI dataset. To validate approximately 7 of these 14 qualities, it's essential to test the effectiveness of several methods. Our analysis is based on supervised learning techniques—K-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, random forests, and decision trees. Experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, sensitivity, and precision of K-nearest neighbor (8 neighbors) compared to SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier with four or eighteen features, and Random Forest classifiers. We employed feature selection methods to enhance classification accuracy and reduce execution time. Additionally, we fine-tuned hyperparameters and applied best practices for model evaluation using the LOOCV method. Classifier performances were evaluated using performance measurement metrics. Implementing this approach significantly improves the model's ability to predict cardiac arrest accurately for any individual. In contrast to previously used classifiers such as Naive Bayes, the current model's accuracy, when utilizing logistic regression and KNN, proved highly promising in predicting indications of a cardiac ailment in a person. Evaluating the classification algorithm's ability to accurately detect cardiovascular disease is pivotal, reducing stress and enhancing treatment while cutting costs. This program has provided insights into predicting the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and was executed using Python.",

        "abstract": "We discuss the problem of support vector machine (SVM) transduction, which is a combinatorial problem with exponential computational complexity in the number of unlabeled samples. Different approaches to such combinatorial problems exist, among which are exact integer programming approaches (only feasible for very small sample sizes, e.g. [1]) and local search heuristics starting from a suitably chosen start value such as the approach explained in Chapter 5, Transductive Support Vector Machines , and introduced in [2] (scalable to large problem sizes, but sensitive to local optima). In this chapter, we discuss an alternative approach introduced in [3], which is based on a convex relaxation of the optimization problem associated to support vector machine transduction. The result is a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem which can be optimized in polynomial time, the solution of which is an approximation of the optimal labeling as well as a bound on the true optimum of the original transduction objective function. To further decrease the computational complexity, we propose an approximation that allows to solve transduction problems of up to 1000 unlabeled samples. Lastly, we extend the formulation to more general settings of semi-supervised learning, where equivalence and inequivalence constraints are given on labels of some of the samples.",

        "abstract": "Over a century ago, Ivan P. Pavlov, in a classic experiment, demonstrated how dogs can learn to associate a ringing bell with food, thereby causing a ring to result in salivation. Today, however, it is rare to find the use of Pavlovian type associative learning for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Instead, other biologically-inspired learning concepts, in particular artificial neural networks (ANNs) have flourished, yielding extensive impact on a wide range of fields including finance, healthcare and transportation. However, learning in such \"conventional\" ANNs, in particular in the form of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are usually carried out using the backpropagation method, is computationally and energy intensive. Here we report the experimental demonstration of backpropagation-free learning, achieved using a single (or monadic) associative hardware element. This is realized on an integrated photonic platform using phase change materials combined with on-chip cascaded directional couplers. We link associative learning with supervised learning, based on their common goal of associating certain inputs with \"correct\" outputs. We then expand the concept to develop larger-scale supervised learning networks using our monadic Pavlovian photonic hardware, developing a distinct machine-learning framework based on single-element associations and, importantly, using backpropagation-free single-layer weight architectures to approach general learning tasks. Our approach not only significantly reduces the computational burden imposed by learning in conventional neural network approaches, thereby increasing speed and decreasing energy use during learning, but also offers higher bandwidth inherent to a photonic implementation, paving the way for future deployment of fast photonic artificially intelligent machines.",

        "title": "Large-scale chemical language representations capture molecular structure and properties",
        "abstract": "Models based on machine learning can enable accurate and fast molecular property predictions, which is of interest in drug discovery and material design. Various supervised machine learning models have demonstrated promising performance, but the vast chemical space and the limited availability of property labels make supervised learning challenging. Recently, unsupervised transformer-based language models pretrained on a large unlabelled corpus have produced state-of-the-art results in many downstream natural language processing tasks. Inspired by this development, we present molecular embeddings obtained by training an efficient transformer encoder model, M o LF ormer , which uses rotary positional embeddings. This model employs a linear attention mechanism, coupled with highly distributed training, on SMILES sequences of 1.1 billion unlabelled molecules from the PubChem and ZINC datasets. We show that the learned molecular representation outperforms existing baselines, including supervised and self-supervised graph neural networks and language models, on several downstream tasks from ten benchmark datasets. They perform competitively on two others. Further analyses, specifically through the lens of attention, demonstrate that M o LF ormer trained on chemical SMILES indeed learns the spatial relationships between atoms within a molecule. These results provide encouraging evidence that large-scale molecular language models can capture sufficient chemical and structural information to predict various distinct molecular properties, including quantum-chemical properties. Large language models have recently emerged with extraordinary capabilities, and these methods can be applied to model other kinds of sequence, such as string representations of molecules. Ross and colleagues have created a transformer-based model, trained on a large dataset of molecules, which provides good results on property prediction tasks.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: In the field of cardiovascular health, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have become effective tools with potential applications ranging from disease detection and diagnosis to individualized treatment planning and decision making. The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the role of AI in cardiovascular health care. Method: The methodology of this review paper involved an extensive literature review of the existing research on the topic of AI in cardiovascular health care. Result: Medical imaging is very important in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, but the interpretation of medical images is often time-consuming and subjective. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, have been developed to assist in the analysis and interpretation of data from medical imaging. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVM) are the two most frequently used AI algorithms in medical image analysis. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in cardiovascular healthcare have great potential to improve patient outcomes and lower costs. However, there are still some hurdles that need to be overcome such as integration with clinical workflows, model validation and generalization, and privacy and security issues related to patient data. To overcome this, collaboration between doctors, researchers and industrial partners is needed. This technology has a bright and promising future with continuous investment in research and development.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a \\textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an \\textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the predominant global cause of mortality, with both low and high temperatures increasing CVD-related mortalities. Climate change impacts human health directly through temperature fluctuations and indirectly via factors like disease vectors. Elevated and reduced temperatures have been linked to increases in CVD-related hospitalizations and mortality, with various studies worldwide confirming the significant health implications of temperature variations and air pollution on cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: A database of daily Emergency Room admissions at the Giovanni XIII Polyclinic in Bari (Southern Italy) was developed, spanning from 2013 to 2019, including weather and air quality data. A Random Forest (RF) supervised machine learning model was used to simulate the trend of hospital admissions for CVD. The Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) decomposition model separated the trend component, while cross-validation techniques were employed to prevent overfitting. Model performance was assessed using specific metrics and error analysis. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, a feature importance technique within the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework, was used to identify the feature importance. Results: An R2 of 0.97 and a Mean Absolute Error of 0.36 admissions were achieved by the model. Atmospheric pressure, minimum temperature, and carbon monoxide were found to collectively contribute about 74% to the model’s predictive power, with atmospheric pressure being the dominant factor at 37%. Conclusions: This research underscores the significant influence of weather-climate variables on cardiovascular diseases. The identified key climate factors provide a practical framework for policymakers and healthcare professionals to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on CVD and devise preventive strategies.",

        "abstract": "As people age, older adults' health begins to slow down. Moreover, the elderly population number will grow in upcoming years, according to statistics. This fact can lead to clinics and the hospitals becoming overloaded, and the demand for supervision becomes a challenge for the healthcare area. Because the majority of health issues are in the kinesiology domain, using new technologies like Kinect Sensor, this paper proposes a home system that implies the serious games for older adults, machine learning models for exercises recognition and remote activity supervision. The aim is to minimize the physical effort by offering a believable and motivating virtual world where the patient simulates kinesiology exercises, responds to quizzes and sends feedback. In the same time, the system recovers the exercise data and interprets it in order to model personalized care solutions, to create user profiles, to calibrate the difficulty level of the game using a language of powerful questions, to analyze the exercises progress and the performance feedback, to detect symptoms or falls and to learn the users' behavior. The approach described in this paper is based on analyses of the existing similar systems and on the statistics regarding the acceptability of the lifestyle in self-management physical level for elders.",

        "title": "Analysis and prediction of unplanned intensive care unit readmission using recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory",
        "abstract": "Background Unplanned readmission of a hospitalized patient is an extremely undesirable outcome as the patient may have been exposed to additional risks. The rates of unplanned readmission are, therefore, regarded as an important performance indicator for the medical quality of a hospital and healthcare system. Identifying high-risk patients likely to suffer from readmission before release benefits both the patients and the medical providers. The emergence of machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities to develop efficient discharge decision-making support system for physicians. Methods and Findings We used supervised machine learning approaches for ICU readmission prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the MIMIC-III to predict the ICU readmission of patients within 30 days of their discharge. We have utilized recent machine learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), by this we have been able incorporate the multivariate features of EHRs and capture sudden fluctuations in chart event features (e.g. glucose and heart rate) that are significant in time series with temporal dependencies, which cannot be properly captured by traditional static models, but can be captured by our proposed deep neural network based model. We incorporate multiple types of features including chart events, demographic, and ICD9 embeddings. Our machine learning models identifies ICU readmissions at a higher sensitivity rate (0.742) and an improved Area Under the Curve (0.791) compared with traditional methods. We also illustrate the importance of each portion of the features and different combinations of the models to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Conclusion Our manuscript highlights the ability of machine learning models to improve our ICU decision making accuracy, and is a real-world example of precision medicine in hospitals. These data-driven results enable clinicians to make assisted decisions within their patient cohorts. This knowledge could have immediate implications for hospitals by improving the detection of possible readmission. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, hospital administration, allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately individualized clinical care.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the major causes of death across the globe. Medical interventions with modern healthcare facilities are widely used to cure lung cancer. However, it is indispensable to have research on early detection of lung cancer as it has potential to save lives of people. With innovations in machine learning Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems for automatic detection of lung cancer has become an important solution. Particularly deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is found to have necessary mechanisms to learn features from Computed Tomography (CT) scan images and detect the probability of lung cancer. In this paper, we propose a CNN based model for automatic detection of lung cancer provided lung CT scan image. We proposed an algorithm known as CNN based Automatic Lung Cancer Detection (CNN-ALCD) which is based on supervised learning phenomenon. The learned model is capable of detecting lung cancer from any newly arrived test sample. The proposed solution has different mechanisms such as preprocessing, building CNN with different layers, training the CNN model and performing lung cancer detection. Empirical study revealed that the proposed CNN based model outperforms many existing neural network-based methods with highest accuracy 94.11%. Therefore, the proposed system can be integrated with a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) in healthcare units for automatic diagnosis of lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art approaches for weather and climate modeling are based on physics-informed numerical models of the atmosphere. These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pre-trained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pre-trained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.

        "title": "Characterization of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus using natural language processing within an electronic healthcare record system.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nIdiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is an underdiagnosed, progressive, and disabling condition. Early treatment is associated with better outcomes and improved quality of life. In this paper, the authors aimed to identify features associated with patients with iNPH using natural language processing (NLP) to characterize this cohort, with the intention to later target the development of artificial intelligence-driven tools for early detection.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe electronic health records of patients with shunt-responsive iNPH were retrospectively reviewed using an NLP algorithm. Participants were selected from a prospectively maintained single-center database of patients undergoing CSF diversion for probable iNPH (March 2008-July 2020). Analysis was conducted on preoperative health records including clinic letters, referrals, and radiology reports accessed through CogStack. Clinical features were extracted from these records as SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) concepts using a named entity recognition machine learning model. In the first phase, a base model was generated using unsupervised training on 1 million electronic health records and supervised training with 500 double-annotated documents. The model was fine-tuned to improve accuracy using 300 records from patients with iNPH double annotated by two blinded assessors. Thematic analysis of the concepts identified by the machine learning algorithm was performed, and the frequency and timing of terms were analyzed to describe this patient group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 293 eligible patients responsive to CSF diversion were identified. The median age at CSF diversion was 75 years, with a male predominance (69% male). The algorithm performed with a high degree of precision and recall (F1 score 0.92). Thematic analysis revealed the most frequently documented symptoms related to mobility, cognitive impairment, and falls or balance. The most frequent comorbidities were related to cardiovascular and hematological problems.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis model demonstrates accurate, automated recognition of iNPH features from medical records. Opportunities for translation include detecting patients with undiagnosed iNPH from primary care records, with the aim to ultimately improve outcomes for these patients through artificial intelligence-driven early detection of iNPH and prompt treatment.",

        "title": "Prediction Methods of Common Cancers in China Using PCA-ANN and DBN-ELM-BP",
        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of cancer cases is crucial for diagnosis of cancer at an early stage because a long-lasting chronic disease is harmful to both physical and mental health. While medical data about healthcare and health obtained from questionnaire, the true positive rate of cancers predicted by traditional methods is low. Machine learning can provide a pattern for classification for types of cancer (mainly including lung cancer, liver cancer, upper gastrointestinal cancer, lower gastrointestinal cancer and breast cancer) using instances of early questionnaire screening. The screening covered 3411 respondents in this study. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to generate attributes, coupled with artificial neural network (ANN) technology to conduct cancer prediction by providing 28 attributes into models. While deep belief network (DBN) is used for unsupervised training and extracting relevant attributes. Extreme learning machine (ELM) optimizes DBN and conducts supervised classification. Back propagation (BP) algorithm conducts supervised fine tuning. Finally, PCA-ANN and DBN-ELM-BP common cancers prediction models are established. The training set and testing set of PCA-ANN model gives 35.29% and 37.5% sensitivity, 98.36% and 98.33% specificity, 97.01% and 97.85% accuracy, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.7245 and 0.7221, respectively. While the training set and testing set of DBN-ELM-BP model gives 58.83% and 62.5% sensitivity, 98.31% and 98.52% specificity, 98.03% and 98.24% accuracy, AUC 0.7747 and 0.7238, respectively. The results show that DBN-ELM-BP model can provide a method to predict the possibility of common cancers, which is non-invasive and economical for clinicians to make diagnostic decisions.",

        "title": "Patient Satisfaction and Hospital Quality of Care Evaluation in Malaysia Using SERVQUAL and Facebook",
        "abstract": "Social media sites, dubbed patient online reviews (POR), have been proposed as new methods for assessing patient satisfaction and monitoring quality of care. However, the unstructured nature of POR data derived from social media creates a number of challenges. The objectives of this research were to identify service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions automatically from hospital Facebook reviews using a machine learning classifier, and to examine their associations with patient dissatisfaction. From January 2017 to December 2019, empirical research was conducted in which POR were gathered from the official Facebook page of Malaysian public hospitals. To find SERVQUAL dimensions in POR, a machine learning topic classification utilising supervised learning was developed, and this study’s objective was established using logistic regression analysis. It was discovered that 73.5% of patients were satisfied with the public hospital service, whereas 26.5% were dissatisfied. SERVQUAL dimensions identified were 13.2% reviews of tangible, 68.9% of reliability, 6.8% of responsiveness, 19.5% of assurance, and 64.3% of empathy. After controlling for hospital variables, all SERVQUAL dimensions except tangible and assurance were shown to be significantly related with patient dissatisfaction (reliability, p < 0.001; responsiveness, p = 0.016; and empathy, p < 0.001). Rural hospitals had a higher probability of patient dissatisfaction (p < 0.001). Therefore, POR, assisted by machine learning technologies, provided a pragmatic and feasible way for capturing patient perceptions of care quality and supplementing conventional patient satisfaction surveys. The findings offer critical information that will assist healthcare authorities in capitalising on POR by monitoring and evaluating the quality of services in real time.",

        "abstract": "In Mexico, the estimated Maternal Mortality Ratio is 34.6 deaths per 100,000 estimated births. Consequently, healthcare facilities and services have given precedence to prenatal care, childbirth services, and postpartum care. In Mexico, the Ministry of Health maintains an open database concerning maternal deaths, encompassing 58 variables. Among these variables is the CIE (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems), which covers a total of 248 diseases linked to maternal deaths. Currently, there is no software that classifies women undergoing pregnancy check-ups (according to their socio-clinical risk of mortality), using variables selected with data science. This project is rooted in the methodology advanced by International Business Machines (IBM) for the implementation of data science. The software's utilized model was constructed through the Naïve Bayes supervised learning algorithm, yielding an accuracy of 0.7236. The overall precision stood at 0.75, with an overall recall of 0.74, and an overall F1-score of 0.71. For the eclampsia during labor class, precision reached 0.71, recall was 0.94, and the F1- score attained 0.81. As for secondary or late postpartum hemorrhage, precision scored 0.81, recall measured 0.43, and the F1-score was 0.56.",

        "abstract": "Contactless or non-invasive technology has a significant impact on healthcare applications such as the prediction of COVID-19 symptoms. Non-invasive methods are essential especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as they minimise the burden on healthcare personnel. One notable symptom of COVID-19 infection is a rapid respiratory rate, which requires constant real-time monitoring of respiratory patterns. In this paper, Software Defined Radio (SDR) based Radio-Frequency sensing technique and supervised machine learning algorithm is employed to provide a platform for detecting and monitoring various respiratory: eupnea, biot, bradypnea, sighing, tachypnea, and kussmaul. The variations in Channel State Information produced by human respiratory were utilised to identify distinct respiratory patterns using fine-grained Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing signals. The proposed platform based on the SDR and the Deep Multilayer Perceptron classifier exhibits the ability to effectively detect and classify the afore-mentioned distinct respiratory with an accuracy of up to 99%. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of diagnosis accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix is demonstrated by comparison with a state-of-the-art machine learning classifier: Random Forest.",

Current approaches for smart-phone based activity recognition focus only on simple activities such as locomotion. In this paper, in addition to recognizing simple activities, we investigate the ability to recognize complex activities, such as cooking, cleaning, etc. through a smart phone. Features extracted from the raw inertial sensor data of the smart phone corresponding to the user's activities, are used to train and test supervised machine learning algorithms. The results from the experiments conducted on ten participants indicate that, in isolation, while simple activities can be easily recognized, the performance of the prediction models on complex activities is poor. However, the prediction model is robust enough to recognize simple activities even in the presence of complex activities.",

        "abstract": "Objective Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, SARS-CoV2 has claimed more than six million lives world-wide, with over 510 million cases to date. To reduce healthcare burden, we must investigate how to prevent non-acute disease from progressing to severe infection requiring hospitalization. Methods To achieve this goal, we investigated metabolic signatures of both non-acute (out-patient) and severe (requiring hospitalization) COVID-19 samples by profiling the associated plasma metabolomes of 84 COVID-19 positive University of Virginia hospital patients. We utilized supervised and unsupervised machine learning and metabolic modeling approaches to identify key metabolic drivers that are predictive of COVID-19 disease severity. Using metabolic pathway enrichment analysis, we explored potential metabolic mechanisms that link these markers to disease progression. Results Enriched metabolites associated with tryptophan in non-acute COVID-19 samples suggest mitigated innate immune system inflammatory response and immunopathology related lung damage prevention. Increased prevalence of histidine- and ketone-related metabolism in severe COVID-19 samples offers potential mechanistic insight to musculoskeletal degeneration-induced muscular weakness and host metabolism that has been hijacked by SARS-CoV2 infection to increase viral replication and invasion. Conclusions Our findings highlight the metabolic transition from an innate immune response coupled with inflammatory pathway inhibition in non-acute infection to rampant inflammation and associated metabolic systemic dysfunction in severe COVID-19.",

This large store of data needs to be administered in a proper manner so that we can derive useful insights and conclusions using a proper analysis system. Such large amount of data is aptly handled through analyzing the unstructured or structured data by utilizing machine learning algorithms. Predictive analytics, a key component of machine learning algorithms, helps users make enhanced and supervised decisions. Visual Analytics is a tool to cost-effectively sort the exuberant and rapidly incrementing data in the field of medical research. It helps us cope with the assorted data in an organized manner, which the human brain would be able to visualize easily. This would in turn provide new innovative and potential results. This analytics not only provides structured data but also initiates structured thoughts in the mind of humans. As practitioners analyze certain anomalous situations, the process of visual analytics process would provide sorted relevant data related to it. This would in turn decrease the cost of maintaining huge amount of data.",

        "abstract": "Patients with influenza and SARS-CoV2/Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections have a different clinical course and outcomes. We developed and validated a supervised machine learning pipeline to distinguish the two viral infections using the available vital signs and demographic dataset from the first hospital/emergency room encounters of 3883 patients who had confirmed diagnoses of influenza A/B, COVID-19 or negative laboratory test results. The models were able to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of at least 97% using our multiclass classifier. The predictive models were externally validated on 15,697 encounters in 3125 patients available on TrinetX database that contains patient-level data from different healthcare organizations. The influenza vs COVID-19-positive model had an AUC of 98.8%, and 92.8% on the internal and external test sets, respectively. Our study illustrates the potentials of machine-learning models for accurately distinguishing the two viral infections. The code is made available at https://github.com/ynaveena/COVID-19-vs-Influenza and may have utility as a frontline diagnostic tool to aid healthcare workers in triaging patients once the two viral infections start cocirculating in the communities.",

        "abstract": "Firm-level stock returns differ enormously in reaction to COVID-19 news. We characterize these reactions using the Risk Factors discussions in pre-pandemic 10-K filings and two text-analytic approaches: expert-curated dictionaries and supervised machine learning (ML). Bad COVID-19 news lowers returns for firms with high exposures to travel, traditional retail, aircraft production and energy supply -- directly and via downstream demand linkages -- and raises them for firms with high exposures to healthcare policy, e-commerce, web services, drug trials and materials that feed into supply chains for semiconductors, cloud computing and telecommunications. Monetary and fiscal policy responses to the pandemic strongly impact firm-level returns as well, but differently than pandemic news. Despite methodological differences, dictionary and ML approaches yield remarkably congruent return predictions. Importantly though, ML operates on a vastly larger feature space, yielding richer characterizations of risk exposures and outperforming the dictionary approach in goodness-of-fit. By integrating elements of both approaches, we uncover new risk factors and sharpen our explanations for firm-level returns. To illustrate the broader utility of our methods, we also apply them to explain firm-level returns in reaction to the March 2020 Super Tuesday election results.",

        "abstract": "Hand sanitization by healthcare staff remains one of the most effective ways for controlling infection in healthcare settings. However, predicting faithful adherence to Hand Hygiene Compliance (HHC) is difficult in complex environments such as inpatient hospital settings. The main challenge is understanding how different components of human and built systems interact to achieve specific goals such as HHC at the critical moments of care delivery. The aim of this explorative study was to evaluate how Human Factors derived visual salience cues and proximity-compatibility principles might be used in the design of healthcare spaces to support nurse moments of HHC through increased perceived behavioral control and intention. The investigative team used a Collaborative Computational Scenario Planning (CCSP) Model approach to determine the integrative effects of reinforcing and detracting operational and environmental factors on discrete moments of HHC behavior. Supervised Machine Learning analysis was conducted on data collected by a large academic medical center that included HHC observance in clinical staff spanning from 2017 to 2021 in two inpatient hospital units. The probabilistic outcomes of unit based HHC observance likelihood were used to compute Fuzzy Cognitive Model Edge Probabilities between Hand Hygiene (HH) cues and detected HHC at key moments. Hospital infection control experts were then engaged to identify the weight of various reinforcing and detracting operational and environmental factors contributing to HHC observance. Combining the quantitative and qualitative methods, allowed the team to then develop integrative CCSP models which facilitated predictive insight into the development of targeted environmental improvements that might contribute to HHC control and intention to support safer patient care.",

        "abstract": "KEY POINTS With the advancement of available clinical and health data as well as the growth of big data in different healthcare disciplines, artificial intelligence is becoming a prevalent emerging technology to predict disease risks, disease diagnoses, courses of illness, and treatments. A simplified meaning of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning methods is illustrated for future nursing informatics research. Current use ofmachine learning and deep learning in nursing education is described and research and recommendations for future use are presented. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Artificial intelligence (AI) has been defined as an area of study in computer science concerned with the ability to make computers do things that would require intelligence if done by humans. Artificial intelligence is a new-old science. Artificial intelligence concepts were presented in the 1950s; however, due to the scarcity of electronic data, at that time, its use for further discovery was still immature. Nowadays, with the growth of electronic data, AI is growing in importance in many disciplines. In healthcare and nursing science, with widespread implementation of electronic health records and electronic documentation, big data in terms of large volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of data aremore available. Large warehouses of structured and unstructured nursing data will enhance the use of AI technology to create more meanings that can be used in research to improve nursing practice and management. Artificial intelligence is the ability to use machine learning to imitate humans' cognitive abilities by using numerous statistical and algorithmic calculations in understanding, problem solving, and decision making. Artificial intelligence is a broad concept under which are machine learning and deep learning (Figure 1). Machine learning (Table 1) has three subfields; each uses different assumptions and mathematical frameworks for how data are ingested and how learning occurs within the algorithm. The subfields of machine learning are (1) supervised learning; (2) unsupervised learning; and (3) reinforcement learning (semisupervised learning). Supervised learning requires labeled data sets, which is the process of attaching meaning to different types of digital data such as text, audio files, images, videos and more. This environment includes a known data domain and known response (labeled) set. Therefore, a supervised learning model and an algorithm deal with an environment where the given",

        "title": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Based Framework for Enhanced Diagnosis and Classification of COVID-19 Pneumonia",
        "abstract": "COVID-19 pneumonia is a persistent worldwide health problem that usually affects the most vulnerable groups in society: the newborn and aged populations. Most of the current endeavors toward handling diagnosis and classification of pneumonia have used numerous techniques for machine learning and deep learning, with a particular focus on COVID-19 pneumonia. However, most of these techniques have raised concerns with regard to diagnostic precision as a result of the limited application of advanced algorithms, datasets whose validation is mostly inadequate and predictive capability. To address these limitations, our research introduces a deep learning-based approach by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which enhances the performance in classifying COVID-19 pneumonia. Salient features of the proposed method include a four-step process: first, data acquisition from a comprehensive chest X-ray dataset on GitHub; second, processing and analyzing the data through visual means like histograms and scatter plots; third, using CNNs supplemented with techniques for data augmentation in supervised learning; lastly, performance evaluation to benchmark against existing models. The present study uses features from X-ray images with the help of CNN's advanced pattern recognition capabilities in pursuit of achieving better generalization and precision in classification. The model achieved an accuracy of 85.70\\% and precision of 88.6%, which surpasses the existing techniques and thereby built the promise of improving the accuracy of the diagnostic process, hence, leading to improved care for the patients, and more so forms the foundation on which future AI-powered healthcare diagnostics are expected to take off.",

        "title": "Edge Inference for UWB Ranging Error Correction Using Autoencoders",
        "abstract": "Indoor localization knows many applications, such as industry 4.0, warehouses, healthcare, drones, etc., where high accuracy becomes more critical than ever. Recent advances in ultra-wideband localization systems allow high accuracies for multiple active users in line-of-sight environments, while they still introduce errors above 300 mm in non-line-of-sight environments due to multi-path effects. Current work tries to improve the localization accuracy of ultra-wideband through offline error correction approaches using popular machine learning techniques. However, these techniques are still limited to simple environments with few multi-path effects and focus on offline correction. With the upcoming demand for high accuracy and low latency indoor localization systems, there is a need to deploy (online) efficient error correction techniques with fast response times in dynamic and complex environments. To address this, we propose (i) a novel semi-supervised autoencoder-based machine learning approach for improving ranging accuracy of ultra-wideband localization beyond the limitations of current improvements while aiming for performance improvements and a small memory footprint and (ii) an edge inference architecture for online UWB ranging error correction. As such, this paper allows the design of accurate localization systems by using machine learning for low-cost edge devices. Compared to a deep neural network (as state-of-the-art, with a baseline error of 75 mm) the proposed autoencoder achieves a 29% higher accuracy. The proposed approach leverages robust and accurate ultra-wideband localization, which reduces the errors from 214 mm without correction to 58 mm with correction. Validation of edge inference using the proposed autoencoder on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano demonstrates significant uplink bandwidth savings and allows up to 20 rapidly ranging anchors per edge GPU.",

        "title": "Iterative Annotation of Biomedical NER Corpora with Deep Neural Networks and Knowledge Bases",
        "abstract": "The large availability of clinical natural language documents, such as clinical narratives or diagnoses, requires the definition of smart automatic systems for their processing and analysis, but the lack of annotated corpora in the biomedical domain, especially in languages different from English, makes it difficult to exploit the state-of-art machine-learning systems to extract information from such kinds of documents. For these reasons, healthcare professionals lose big opportunities that can arise from the analysis of this data. In this paper, we propose a methodology to reduce the manual efforts needed to annotate a biomedical named entity recognition (B-NER) corpus, exploiting both active learning and distant supervision, respectively based on deep learning models (e.g., Bi-LSTM, word2vec FastText, ELMo and BERT) and biomedical knowledge bases, in order to speed up the annotation task and limit class imbalance issues. We assessed this approach by creating an Italian-language electronic health record corpus annotated with biomedical domain entities in a small fraction of the time required for a fully manual annotation. The obtained corpus was used to train a B-NER deep neural network whose performances are comparable with the state of the art, with an F1-Score equal to 0.9661 and 0.8875 on two test sets.",

        "title": "Ophthalmology and Artificial Intelligence: Present or Future? A Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Perspective of the Pursuit for Fairness",
        "abstract": "Computers that simulate human thought were first described in 1950, with the first artificial intelligence (AI) publication in 1943 describing a computer model that generated an autonomous binary output inspired by a human neuron (1). Since then, advances in machine learning and deep learning have expanded AI and created new paradigms in computer science. In healthcare, automatic processes facilitate diagnosis prediction, medical care, smart medical devices implementation, workflow improvement, electronic medical records interpretation, and screening programs (2, 3). Convolutional neural networks are examples of deep learning analytics applied to image processing; they simulate interconnected neurons and provide output after multiple interconnected information layers (2). Machine learning algorithms could be unsupervised, supervised, or reinforced; in every learning method, the construction of datasets is a critical step (3). More than twenty thousand articles have been published regarding AI in the last five years, with more than 1000 pertaining to ophthalmology. Regarding the retina subspecialty, AI has been applied in disease screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and retinopathy of prematurity (4). AI has already been applied in the IDx-DR system, the first FDA-approved device, with good results in Caucasian, North African, and Sub-Saharan populations (5). In the European Union, EyeArt has been used to exclude low-quality images, estimate DR progression, and recommend referral (5). Other algorithms, including Google’s, Singapore’s SERI-NUS, the Bosch DR Algorithm, and Retinalyze, have been developed (5). Algorithms have also been developed to support decision-making, e.g., in the anti-angiogenic treatment of AMD (6). Despite technological advances, many challenges hamper real-world implementation of AI, such as variability in algorithm performance, patient acceptance in automated processes, and ethical conflicts. Therefore, this article’s objective was to compare characteristics of open-access retinal fundus photos datasets, implementations of AI in ophthalmology, and challenges to AI application in ophthalmology.",

        "title": "Early diagnosis of autism using indian autism grading tool",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder is a neuro-developmental disorder that affects communication and social skills in individuals. Screening and diagnosis of autism using conventional methods, such as interviews with parents or caregivers and observational assessments takes a long time. The accurate diagnosis of autism by physicians and healthcare professionals seems to be challenging. By analyzing data on autistic children, medical professionals can learn about autism screening assessment decision making. The present study aims to develop a parental autism screening tool termed the Indian Autism Grading Tool (IAGT) for early screening of autism. Data are collected using the Indian Autism Parental Questionnaire and assigned with grades. This dataset is employed to test five supervised machine learning models, which compare classification performance based on accuracy, precision and recall. The most effective model should be used to implement the autism screening application. MLR is known to be more robust and to support fewer data sets, so it can be employed for the implementation of ML-powered mobile applications. MLR achieves the overall accuracy of 97.85%, which equates to 0.72%, 2.37%, 0.84% and 1.54% better than SVM, DT, KNN and GNB respectively. The proposed tool is developed in both Tamil and English. The pilot study is conducted with 30 children and the predictability of the tool is compared with the clinician. Therefore, the tool consistently achieves the same level of accuracy as clinicians.",

In medical and healthcare, due to management and the availability of computers, data mining is growing. Such a large amount of data cannot be processed by humans in a short time to make a diagnosis and treatment schedules. In this paper, machine learning-based algorithms are used for predicting the number of novel corona virus (COVID-19) positive and negative reported cases. The proposed methodology includes two stages. The first stage, Covid-19 India cases are classified using a supervised Naïve Bayes classifier. In the second stage, the final major Covid-19 India cases predict using the machine learning-based Kalman filter method. Indian states are classified into several zones based on the spread of positive and daily growth rates for simple classification of novel corona virus hot- spots. The proposed method results show better than the current state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022 Author(s).",

        "title": "Efficient Discrete Feature Encoding for Variational Quantum Classifier",
        "abstract": "Recent days have witnessed significant interests in applying quantum-enhanced techniques for solving machine learning tasks in, e.g., classification, regression, and recommender systems. Variational methods that use quantum resources of imperfect quantum devices with the help of classical computing techniques are popular for supervised learning. Variational Quantum Classification (VQC) is one of such variational methods with possible quantum advantage in using quantum-enhanced features that are hard to compute by classical methods. Its performance depends on the mapping of classical features into quantum-enhanced feature space. Although there have been many quantum-mapping functions proposed so far, there is little discussion on efficient mapping of discrete features, such as, race, gender, marriage status and others that are often significant for classifying datasets of interest. We first introduce the use of Quantum Random Access Coding (QRAC) to map such discrete features efficiently into limited number of qubits for VQC. We numerically show that QRAC can help speeding up the training of VQC by reducing its parameters via reduction on the number of qubits for the mapping. We confirm the effectiveness of the QRAC in VQC by experimenting on classification of healthcare datasets with both simulators and real quantum devices.",

The main point of this paper is that by adding linguistic knowledge to the representation (such as syntactic features), rather than relying only on statistics (such as term frequency and n-grams), a better result is obtained as measured by keywords previously assigned by professional indexers. In more detail, extracting NP-chunks gives a better precision than n-grams, and by adding the PoS tag(s) assigned to the term as a feature, a dramatic improvement of the results is obtained, independent of the term selection approach applied.",

        "title": "Enhanced ResNet-18: A Novel Approach for Automated Classification and Early Detection of Eye Diseases",
        "abstract": "Eye disease classification is a topic of much concern among states worldwide. The object is to apply advanced algorithms developed on the basis of research to a variety of previous models and thus make them more flexible in an attempt to accurately diagnose all sorts of eye diseases using photographs as evidence. This paper adopted the methods of machine learning and computer vision to classify images for four types of eye disorders: cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and normal conditions. In this study, we retrained ResNet-18 with a learning rate of 5x10^-5 within the ResNet-18 block and 8x10^-4 for additional dense layers. The performance of our model was excellent, with an overall accuracy of 0.86. Especially notable was that the model had high precision, recall, and F1-score for diabetic retinopathy cataract. But for other glaucoma groups, it scored markedly lower on these metrics. These results clearly suggest the potential of the model for early discovery, diagnosis, supervision, and treatment plans for eye diseases and will thus be of immense benefit to human society in general as well as individual medical treatments. This will contribute to society by contributing positively to the general level of medical care. Doctors and nurses everywhere are using these results as a general reference manual, aiming for high-quality outcomes at a reasonable cost throughout the healthcare industry.",

        "abstract": "Qualitative research can produce a rich understanding of a phenomenon but requires an essential and strenuous data annotation process known as coding. Coding can be repetitive and time-consuming, particularly for large datasets. Existing AI-based approaches for partially automating coding, like supervised machine learning (ML) or explicit knowledge represented in code rules, require high technical literacy and lack transparency. Further, little is known about the interaction of researchers with AI-based coding assistance. We introduce Cody, an AI-based system that semi-automates coding through code rules and supervised ML. Cody supports researchers with interactively (re)defining code rules and uses ML to extend coding to unseen data. In two studies with qualitative researchers, we found that (1) code rules provide structure and transparency, (2) explanations are commonly desired but rarely used, (3) suggestions benefit coding quality rather than coding speed, increasing the intercoder reliability, calculated with Krippendorff’s Alpha, from 0.085 (MAXQDA) to 0.33 (Cody).",

Here we will describe the basic structure of a machine learning algorithm (input information, task to execute, output result, optimization, and adjustment), its main classifications (supervised, unsupervised and by reinforcement) and the main modeling methods used. We will review regression and then explore decision trees, support vector machines, principal component analysis, clustering, K-means, hierarchical clustering, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks.

        "abstract": "Counterfactual explanation has been the core of interpretable machine learning, which requires a trained model to be able to not only infer but also justify its inference. This problem is crucial in many fields, such as fintech and the healthcare industry, where accurate decisions and their justifications are equally important. Many studies have leveraged the power of deep generative models for counterfactual generation. However, most focus on vision data and leave the latent space unsupervised. In this paper, we propose a new and general framework that uses a supervised extension to the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) with Normalizing Flow (NF) for simultaneous classification and counterfactual generation. We show experiments on two tabular financial data-sets, Lending Club (LCD) and Give Me Some Credit (GMC), which show that the model can achieve a state-of-art level prediction accuracy while also producing meaningful counterfactual examples to interpret and justify the classifier’s decision.",

        "abstract": "Human Context Recognition (HCR) from smart-phone sensor data is an essential task in Context-Aware (CA) systems including those targeting healthcare and security. Two types of smartphone HCR studies (and datasets) have become popular for training HCR models: a) scripted and b) Unscripted/In-the-wild. Supervised machine learning HCR models can achieve good performance on scripted datasets due to their high quality labels but such models generalize poorly to in-the-wild datasets which are more representative of real-world scenarios. In-the-wild datasets are often imbalanced, have missing or wrong labels, with a diversity of phone placements and smartphone models. Lab-to-field approaches try to train HCR models to learn a robust data representation from a high-fidelity, scripted dataset that is used to improve performance on noisy in-the-wild datasets that have similar labels without having to incur the high expense of gathering high-quality labeled dataset. In this paper, leveraging coincident datasets with the same HCR labels collected in separate scripted and unscripted studies, we propose Triplet-based Domain Adaptation for context REcognition (Triple-DARE), a novel lab-to-field neural networks method with three key components: 1) a domain alignment loss to learn domain-invariant embeddings, 2) a classification loss to maintain task-discriminative features, 3) a joint fusion triplet loss designed to increase intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in the embedding space of multi-labeled datasets. In rigorous evaluation, Triple-DARE improved on the F1-score and classification accuracy of state-of-the-art HCR baselines by 6.3% and 4.5%, respectively, and on HCR models with no adaptation by 44.6% and 10.7%, respectively.",

While the field is innovative, the access to cutting-edge technology is limited with reference to the global population. A significant way to improve overall healthcare is to understand the needs and possibilities of all possible consumers when developing sophisticated and accurate medical devices. The Smartphone-based Keratograph (SBK), is an example of a new project that uses real world feedback, addresses an unmet medical need, and implements commercially available components to create a device that is affordable, portable and simplistic to operate. The long-term goal of the SBK is to collect data from users for supervised machine-learning. This machine-learning aspect will ultimately aid in the development of an artificial intelligence device to enable even earlier detection of keratoconus, especially in children and adolescents. Again, the ultimate goal of any medical device should be to improve patient care, and to make a significant improvement on vision healthcare for the global population, providing access to this technology is essential.",

        "abstract": "Named entity recognition and entity linking are core natural language processing components that are predominantly solved by supervised machine learning approaches. Such supervised machine learning approaches require manual annotation of training data that can be expensive to compile. The applicability of supervised, machine learning-based entity recognition and linking components in real-world applications can be hindered by the limited availability of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses ontologies as a basis for entity recognition and linking, and captures context of neighboring tokens of the entities of interest with vectors based on syntactic and semantic features. Our approach takes user feedback so that the vector-based model can be continuously updated in an online setting. Here we demonstrate our approach in a healthcare context, using it to recognize body part and imaging modality entities within clinical documents, and map these entities to the right concepts in the RadLex and NCIT medical ontologies. Our current evaluation shows promising results on a small set of clinical documents with a precision and recall of 0.841 and 0.966. The evaluation also demonstrates that our approach is capable of continuous performance improvement with increasing size of examples. We believe that our human-in-the-loop, online learning approach to entity recognition and linking shows promise that it is suitable for real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) using smartphones provides significant healthcare guidance for telemedicine and long-term treatment. Machine learning and deep learning (DL) techniques are widely utilized for the scientific study of the statistical models of human behaviors. However, the performance of existing HAR platforms is limited by complex physical activity. In this article, we proposed an adaptive recognition and real-time monitoring system for human activities (Ada-HAR), which is expected to identify more human motions in dynamic situations. The Ada-HAR framework introduces an unsupervised online learning algorithm that is independent of the number of class constraints. Furthermore, the adopted hierarchical clustering and classification algorithms label and classify 12 activities (five dynamics, six statics, and a series of transitions) autonomously. Finally, practical experiments have been performed to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithms. Compared with the methods mentioned in the literature, the results show that the DL-based classifier obtains a higher recognition rate ($\\text{95.15}\\%$, waist, and $\\text{92.20}\\%$, pocket). The decision-tree-based classifier is the fastest method for modal evolution. Finally, the Ada-HAR system can monitor human activity in real time, regardless of the direction of the smartphone.",

        "title": "WiWeHAR: Multimodal Human Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi and Wearable Sensing Modalities",
        "abstract": "Robust and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) systems are essential to many human-centric services within active assisted living and healthcare facilities. Traditional HAR systems mostly leverage a single sensing modality (e.g., either wearable, vision, or radio frequency sensing) combined with machine learning techniques to recognize human activities. Such unimodal HAR systems do not cope well with real-time changes in the environment. To overcome this limitation, new HAR systems that incorporate multiple sensing modalities are needed. Multiple diverse sensors can provide more accurate and complete information resulting in better recognition of the performed activities. This article presents WiWeHAR—a multimodal HAR system that uses combined Wi-Fi and wearable sensing modalities to simultaneously sense the performed activities. WiWeHAR makes use of standard Wi-Fi network interface cards to collect the channel state information (CSI) and a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer sensors to collect the user’s local body movements. We compute the time-variant mean Doppler shift (MDS) from the processed CSI data and magnitude from the inertial data for each sensor of the IMU. Thereafter, we separately extract various time- and frequency-domain features from the magnitude data and the MDS. We apply feature-level fusion to combine the extracted features, and finally supervised learning techniques are used to recognize the performed activities. We evaluate the performance of WiWeHAR by using a multimodal human activity data set, which was obtained from 9 participants. Each participant carried out four activities, such as walking, falling, sitting, and picking up an object from the floor. Our results indicate that the proposed multimodal WiWeHAR system outperforms the unimodal CSI, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer HAR systems and achieves an overall recognition accuracy of 99.6%–100%.",

        "abstract": "In the healthcare systems, usage of advanced integrated technologies like Internet of things (IoT) and Machine learning (ML) techniques were limited. Different amalgams of IoT devices and ML mechanisms are available for medical sector but are limited to certain domains only. These models either provide patients current state data or specific domain analyzing and surveillance pre/post treatment data like heart or brain functions with corresponding medical aid. Also data available is used as clinical study for medical professionals and for better understandings of patients about their state. Specific domain gadgets' like wrist bands or smart bands uses some sensors about vital, temperature and pulse etc., checkups are available but they were not meant for diagnosing or for treatments. In this paper, we proposed an integrated model to use IoT and ML algorithms for a healthcare system. Tracking of patients' status can be done using some sensors such as lightweight, portable, and low-powered sensor nodes. These Sensors sense the patient's status and send the parametric data to the central controller, to take actions during the critical condition of the patients. The data sent to the controller always provided in secure and encryption form. At the same time, patient data is sent to doctors, so that they can provide the instructions to the caretakers of the patients with quick and proper solutions in real-time. For disease prediction, our model uses supervised machine learning algorithms, In order to get the efficient feature set and improve the better accuracy, and pre-processing techniques to eliminate features that are irrelevant, missing values and outliers from biomedical data which aids in better disease prediction. To further strengthen the proposed integrated model design is compared with various traditional classification algorithms to specify its improved accuracy and computational time for accurate prediction of the patient's disease and acts as a decision support system for health care assistants.",

        "abstract": "Class imbalance can often degrade predictive performance of supervised learning algorithms. Balanced classes can be obtained by oversampling exact copies, with noise, or interpolation between nearest neighbours (as in traditional SMOTE methods). Oversampling tabular data using augmentation, as is typical in computer vision tasks, can be achieved with deep generative models. Deep generative models are effective data synthesisers due to their ability to capture complex underlying distributions. Synthetic data in healthcare can enhance interoperability between healthcare providers by ensuring patient privacy. Equipped with large synthetic datasets which do well to represent small patient groups, machine learning in healthcare can address the current challenges of bias and generalisability. This paper evaluates synthetic data generators ability to synthesise patient electronic health records. We test the utility of synthetic data for patient outcome classification, observing increased predictive performance when augmenting imbalanced datasets with synthetic data.",

        "abstract": "The novel paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining recognition in the numerous scenarios promoting the pervasive presence of smart things around us through its application in various areas of society, which includes transportation, healthcare, industries, and agriculture. One more such application is in the smart office to monitor the health of devices via machine learning (ML) that makes the equipment more efficient by allowing real-time monitoring of their health. It guarantees indoor comfort as per the user's satisfaction as it emphasizes on fault prediction in real-life devices. Early identification of various types of faults in IoT devices is the key requirement in smart offices. IoT devices are becoming ubiquitous and provide an assistant to supervise an office that is regulated by ML and data received from sensors is stored in cloud. A recommender system facilitates the selection of an appropriate solution for faults in IoT-enabled devices to mitigate faults. The architecture proposed in this paper is used to monitor each and every office appliance connected via IoT technology using ML technique, and recommender system is used to recommend solutions for fault patterns without much human intervention. The ultrasonic motion sensor is used to fetch the information of employee availability in cubicles and data is sent to the cloud through the WiFi module. ATmega8 is used to control electrical appliances in the office environment. The significance of this work is to forecast the faults in IoT appliances which will have an impact on life and reliability of IoT appliances. The main objective is to design a prototype of a smart office using IoT that can control and automate workplace devices and forecast whether the device needs repairing or replacing, thus reducing the overall burden on the employee and helping out in increasing physical as well as mental health of the person.",

        "abstract": "Computer vision techniques are on the rise for industrial applications, like process supervision and autonomous agents, e.g., in the healthcare domain and dangerous environments. While the general usability of these techniques is high, there are still challenging real-world use-cases. Especially transparent structures, which can appear in the form of glass doors, protective casings or everyday objects like glasses, pose a challenge for computer vision methods. This paper evaluates the combination of transparent objects in conjunction with (naturally occurring) contamination through environmental effects like hazing. We introduce a novel publicly available dataset containing 489 images incorporating three grades of water droplet contamination on transparent structures and examine the resulting influence on transparency handling. Our findings show, that contaminated transparent objects are easier to segment and that we are able to distinguish between different severity levels of contamination with a current state-of-the art machine-learning model. This in turn opens up the possibility to enhance computer vision systems regarding resilience against, e.g., datashifts through contaminated protection casings or implement an automated cleaning alert.",

        "title": "Reimagining Human-Machine Interactions through Trust-Based Feedback",
        "abstract": "Intelligent machines, and more broadly, intelligent systems, are becoming increasingly common in the everyday lives of humans. Nonetheless, despite significant advancements in automation, human supervision and intervention are still essential in almost all sectors, ranging from manufacturing and transportation to disaster-management and healthcare. These intelligent machines interact and collaborate with humans in a way that demands a greater level of trust between human and machine. While a lack of trust can lead to a human's disuse of automation, over-trust can result in a human trusting a faulty autonomous system which could have negative consequences for the human. Therefore, human trust should be calibrated to optimize these human-machine interactions. This calibration can be achieved by designing human-aware automation that can infer human behavior and respond accordingly in real-time.In this dissertation, I present a probabilistic framework to model and calibrate a human's trust and workload dynamics during his/her interaction with an intelligent decision-aid system. More specifically, I develop multiple quantitative models of human trust, ranging from a classical state-space model to a classification model based on machine learning techniques. Both models are parameterized using data collected through human-subject experiments. Thereafter, I present a probabilistic dynamic model to capture the dynamics of human trust along with human workload. This model is used to synthesize optimal control policies aimed at improving context-specific performance objectives that vary automation transparency based on human state estimation. I also analyze the coupled interactions between human trust and workload to strengthen the model framework. Finally, I validate the optimal control policies using closed-loop human subject experiments. The proposed framework provides a foundation toward widespread design and implementation of real-time adaptive automation based on human states for use in human-machine interactions.",

        "abstract": "The most common and widespread disease among today's population is liver disease, which is caused by excessive alcohol consumption, polluted gas produced by various chemical factories, drugs, spoiled or tainted food, and obesity. Liver is the most important body organ as it performs the detoxification process. As a result, early disease detection plays a crucial role in the disease diagnosis and recovery process. Early prediction of liver disease has been made possible with the introduction of machine learning technology. This technology provides significant benefits to the healthcare sector by developing new ways to deploy early disease prediction system even in a remote location. SVM, KNN, K-Mean clustering, neural networks, decision trees, and other machine learning techniques are used to implement liver disease diagnosis in order to provide varying levels of accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning can also be used. This research study intends to compare all the machine learning algorithms to investigate and predict the liver disease and the resultant performance is evaluated based on sensitivity, relevance, accuracy, and precision.",

        "abstract": "Current research on medical image processing relies heavily on the amount and quality of input data. Specifically, supervised machine learning methods require well-annotated datasets. A lack of annotation tools limits the potential to achieve high-volume processing and scaled systems with a proper reward mechanism. We developed MarkIt, a web-based tool, for collaborative annotation of medical imaging data with artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies. Our platform handles both Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and non-DICOM images, and allows users to annotate them for classification and object detection tasks in an efficient manner. MarkIt can accelerate the annotation process and keep track of user activities to calculate a fair reward. A proof-of-concept experiment was conducted with three fellowship-trained radiologists, each of whom annotated 1,000 chest X-ray studies for multi-label classification. We calculated the inter-rater agreement and estimated the value of the dataset to distribute the reward for annotators using a crypto currency. We hypothesize that MarkIt allows the typically arduous annotation task to become more efficient. In addition, MarkIt can serve as a platform to evaluate the value of data and trade the annotation results in a more scalable manner in the future. The platform is publicly available for testing on https://markit.mgh.harvard.edu.",

        "title": "Central Blood Pressure Estimation From Distal PPG Measurement Using Semiclassical Signal Analysis Features",
        "abstract": "Background and objective: Blood pressure (BP) is one of the crucial indicators that contains valuable medical information about cardiovascular activities. Developing photoplethysmography (PPG)-based cuffless BP estimation algorithms with enough robustness and accuracy is clinically useful in practice, due to its simplicity and noninvasiveness. In this paper, we have developed and tested two frameworks for arterial blood pressure (ABP) estimation at the central arteries using photoplethysmography and electrocardiogram. Methods: Supervised learning, as adapted by most studies regarding this topic, is introduced by comparing three machine learning algorithms. Features are extracted using semi-classical signal analysis (SCSA) tools. To further increase the accuracy of estimation, another BP estimation algorithm is presented. A single feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is utilized for BP regression with PPG features, which are extracted by SCSA and later used by FFNN as the network input. Both BP estimation algorithms perform robustly against MIMIC II database to guarantee statistical reliability. Results: We evaluated the performance against the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards, and we have compared the standard deviation (STD) of estimation error with current state of the arts. With the AAMI standard, the first method yields comparable performance against existing literature in the estimation of BP values. Regarding the BHS protocol, the second method achieves grade A in the estimation of BP values. Conclusion: We conclude that by using the PPG signal in combination with informative features from the Schrödinger’s spectrum, the BP can be non-invasively estimated in a reliable and accurate way. Furthermore, the proposed frameworks could potentially enable applications of cuffless estimation of the BP and development of mobile healthcare device.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension account for nearly half of all early deaths every year. Diabetes is a disease that necessitates continuous monitoring of blood sugar levels, particularly glucose, in order to effectively mitigate the emerging health complications. Self-management of the disease, particularly maintaining glucose levels in the blood within a specific range, is critical for treatment. This involves actively monitoring blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as managing diet and physical activity. Diabetes advancements and self-administration applications have made it easier for patients to gain access to more relevant information. The ability of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to solve complex tasks in dynamic environments and with dynamic data has contributed to its success in the study of diseases such as diabetes. This research study has attempted to design and develop a personal healthcare system, which can use the data generated from daily activities and other significant parameters to monitor the blood glucose level and provide proper report representation online. The Machine Learning (ML) technique has been used to detect non-communicable diseases at an early stage. The proposed research study has surveyed previous relevant literatures in order to understand the approaches used previously for the detection or presence of disease in the human body. There are various methods to determine blood glucose levels non-invasively, but a universally acceptable method with good accuracy and precision is not yet available. This paper emphasized about using Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm to determine the probability of occurrence of diabetes mellitus to take precautions accordingly.",

Despite multiple recent successes on statistically and computationally efficient methods, the practical behavior of these algorithms is still poorly understood. We leverage the availability of large numbers of supervised learning datasets to compare and empirically optimize contextual bandit algorithms, focusing on practical methods that learn by relying on optimization oracles from supervised learning. We find that a recent method (Foster et al., 2018) using optimism under uncertainty works the best overall. A surprisingly close second is a simple greedy baseline that only explores implicitly through the diversity of contexts, followed by a variant of Online Cover (Agarwal et al., 2014) which tends to be more conservative but robust to problem specification by design. Along the way, we also evaluate and improve several internal components of contextual bandit algorithm design. Overall, this is a thorough study and review of contextual bandit methodology.",

        "title": "Ontology-Driven Self-Supervision for Adverse Childhood Experiences Identification Using Social Media Datasets",
        "abstract": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are defined as a collection of highly stressful, and potentially traumatic, events or circumstances that occur throughout childhood and/or adolescence. They have been shown to be associated with increased risks of mental health diseases or other abnormal behaviours in later lives. However, the identification of ACEs from textual data with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is challenging because (a) there are no NLP ready ACE ontologies; (b) there are few resources available for machine learning, necessitating the data annotation from clinical experts; (c) costly annotations by domain experts and large number of documents for supporting large machine learning models. In this paper, we present an ontology-driven self-supervised approach (derive concept embeddings using an auto-encoder from baseline NLP results) for producing a publicly available resource that would support large-scale machine learning (e.g., training transformer based large language models) on social media corpus. This resource as well as the proposed approach are aimed to facilitate the community in training transferable NLP models for effectively surfacing ACEs in low-resource scenarios like NLP on clinical notes within Electronic Health Records. The resource including a list of ACE ontology terms, ACE concept embeddings and the NLP annotated corpus is available at https://github.com/knowlab/ACE-NLP.",

        "title": "Interpretable, Multidimensional, Multimodal Anomaly Detection with Negative Sampling for Detection of Device Failure",
        "abstract": "Complex devices are connected daily and eagerly generate vast streams of multidimensional state measurements. These devices often operate in distinct modes based on external conditions (day/night, occupied/vacant, etc.), and to prevent complete or partial system outage, we would like to recognize as early as possible when these devices begin to operate outside the normal modes. Unfortunately, it is often impractical or impossible to predict failures using rules or supervised machine learning, because failure modes are too complex, devices are too new to adequately characterize in a specific environment, or environmental change puts the device into an unpredictable condition. We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method that creates a negative sample from the positive, observed sample, and trains a classifier to distinguish between positive and negative samples. Using the Contraction Principle, we explain why such a classifier ought to establish suitable decision boundaries between normal and anomalous regions, and show how Integrated Gradients can attribute the anomaly to specific variables within the anomalous state vector. We have demonstrated that negative sampling with random forest or neural network classifiers yield significantly higher AUC scores than Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and Deep SVDD, against (a) a synthetic dataset with dimensionality ranging between 2 and 128, with 1, 2, and 3 modes, and with and without noise dimensions; (b) four standard benchmark datasets; and (c) a multidimensional, multimodal dataset from real climate control devices. Finally, we describe how negative sampling with neural network classifiers have been successfully deployed at large scale to predict failures in real time in over 15,000 climate-control and power meter devices in 145 Google office buildings.",

However, only a few studies have focused on non-supervised clustering approaches to building a high-quality patient data set. This study focused on a clustering-aided approach to diagnosis prediction. We leveraged clustering-aided machine learning models to predict elderly falls. First, we used patients' risk factors to build a feature set. The feature set showed a clustering-aided approach could aggregate patient factors that shared similar clinical and demographic characteristics. Subsequently, a K-means clustering approach significantly improved the data set quality. Overall, our study demonstrated that clustering approaches improve the prediction performance of elderly falls. A clustering-aided approach can be applied to similar clinical healthcare practices to potentially improve elderly care.",

        "abstract": "Recently, many applications for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have been developed for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo improve the accuracy of mining structured and unstructured components of the electronic medical record (EMR) by adding temporal features to automatically identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with methotrexate-induced liver transaminase abnormalities.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCodified information and a string-matching algorithm were applied to a RA cohort of 5903 patients from Partners HealthCare to select 1130 patients with potential liver toxicity. Supervised machine learning was applied as our key method. For features, Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) was used to extract standard vocabulary from relevant sections of the unstructured clinical narrative. Temporal features were further extracted to assess the temporal relevance of event mentions with regard to the date of transaminase abnormality. All features were encapsulated in a 3-month-long episode for classification. Results were summarized at patient level in a training set (N=480 patients) and evaluated against a test set (N=120 patients).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe system achieved positive predictive value (PPV) 0.756, sensitivity 0.919, F1 score 0.829 on the test set, which was significantly better than the best baseline system (PPV 0.590, sensitivity 0.703, F1 score 0.642). Our innovations, which included framing the phenotype problem as an episode-level classification task, and adding temporal information, all proved highly effective.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAutomated methotrexate-induced liver toxicity phenotype discovery for patients with RA based on structured and unstructured information in the EMR shows accurate results. Our work demonstrates that adding temporal features significantly improved classification results.",

        "abstract": "Various Supervised learning algorithms or techniques viz. Random Forest, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc are used for the purpose of data classification.. But the question is which of the classification technique accurately identifies this sensitive disorders like Diabetes. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity, are some of the important performance evaluation parameters, which are required to be analysed for every machine learning algorithm. In the performed work, the various classification techniques viz. (NB) Naïve Bayes Classifier, (LR) Logistic Regression, (KNN) K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm, (SVM) Support Vector Machines, and (RF) Random Forest are compared on the basis of the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity as the performance evaluation parameters. The classifiers were exposed to the Pima Indian dataset for classification of diabetes, and their respective performance metrics Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity were compared. It is found that on account of accuracy sensitivity and specificity the Random Forest performed the best on the Pima Indian Dataset for the Diabetes detection.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes is one of the common diseases in the world that cannot be permanently cured, but with proper medication one can lead a long and healthy life by curbing extreme complications. The skills and equipment required to identify the conditions take a longer time to provide an accurate result and are not an affordable means for all the income groups. In order to overcome this issue, an ML model is created and deployed in an application so it will be used by many in predicting the presence of the disease. The chapter focuses on detecting the presence of two major anomalies, namely diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma, which were caused due to diabetes. All the dataset used for the project is gathered from Kaggle and Messidor. Around six machine learning algorithms that fall under supervised learning techniques are executed. Among the many models, the random forest model has a high accuracy of 73% for DR prediction. Simultaneously, glaucoma detection is performed using different algorithms showing that Naive Bayes has the highest accuracy of 98%.",

        "title": "Paving the way to cardiovascular health monitoring using Internet of Medical Things and Edge-AI",
        "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized the healthcare domain, with the introduction of remote real-time monitoring. This emerging technology has not only relieved the burden of hospital resources, but also paved the way for efficient monitoring and management of patients. According to World Health Organization (WHO), in Pakistan, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are leading cause of deaths that amount to nearly 200,000 deaths annually. This results in high mortality rates all over Pakistan. To uplift the current architecture of healthcare in Pakistan, it is vital to develop a sustainable solution for continuous health monitoring and arrest anomalous physiological behavior before they become life-threatening. In the same pretext, this study proposes a working paper which aims to disseminate interim results of smart cardiac health monitoring using an amalgam of IoMT and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective of the proposed research is to integrate state-of-the-art ML classification algorithms to detect, in near real-time, abnormal human vitals like electrocardiogram(ECG), heart-rate(HR), blood pressure(BP), etc. As network latency is critical to this application, therefore, to improve overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the system, we propose to fuse Edge Intelligence interfaced with multiple IoMT enabled bio-sensors. These sensors will form a body area sensor network(BSN) that records cardiac-related human vitals. In our preliminary research, that is presented in this paper, we trained several machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC-III clinical data-set and reviewed their performance. Among the 7 tested supervised classification algorithms, Random-Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95% on the test set. Finally, to offer a remote patient management and monitoring panel, we developed an authenticated web-portal to inculcate data privacy and security in the proposed system.",

        "title": "EpiBOX: An Automated Platform for Long-Term Biosignal Collection",
        "abstract": "Biosignals represent a first-line source of information to understand the behavior and state of human biological systems, often used in machine learning problems. However, the development of healthcare-related algorithms that are both personalized and robust requires the collection of large volumes of data to capture representative instances of all possible states. While the rise of flexible biosignal acquisition solutions has enabled the expedition of data collection, they often require complicated frameworks or do not provide the customization required in some research contexts. As such, EpiBOX was developed as an open-source, standalone, and automated platform that enables the long-term acquisition of biosignals, passable to be operated by individuals with low technological proficiency. In particular, in this paper, we present an in-depth explanation of the framework, methods for the evaluation of its performance, and the corresponding findings regarding the perspective of the end-user. The impact of the network connection on data transfer latency was studied, demonstrating innocuous latency values for reasonable signal strengths and manageable latency values even when the connection was unstable. Moreover, performance profiling of the EpiBOX user interface (mobile application) indicates a suitable performance in all aspects, providing an encouraging outlook on adherence to the system. Finally, the experience of our research group is described as a use case, indicating a promising outlook regarding the use of the EpiBOX framework within similar contexts. As a byproduct of these features, our hope is that by empowering physicians, technicians, and monitored subjects to supervise the biosignal collection process, we enable researchers to scale biosignal collection.",

        "abstract": "Individuals with cognitive impairment can benefit from intervention strategies like recording important information in a memory notebook. However, training individuals to use the notebook on a regular basis requires a constant delivery of reminders. In this study, we design and evaluate machine-learning-based methods for providing automated reminders using a digital memory notebook interface. Specifically, we identify transition periods between activities as times to issue prompts. We consider the problem of detecting activity transitions using supervised and unsupervised machine-learning techniques and find that both techniques show promising results for detecting transition periods. We test the techniques in a scripted setting with 15 individuals. Motion sensors data are recorded and annotated as participants perform a fixed set of activities. We also test the techniques in an unscripted setting with eight individuals. Motion sensor data are recorded as participants go about their normal daily routine. In both the scripted and unscripted settings, a true positive rate of greater than 80% can be achieved while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 15%. On average, this leads to transitions being detected within 1 min of a true transition for the scripted data and within 2 min of a true transition on the unscripted data.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state, generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining.",

        "title": "Emerging Value-Based Radiology in the Era of Artificial Intelligence",
        "abstract": "Radiology has a long history of adopting state-of-the-art digital technology to provide better diagnostic services and facilitate advances in image-based therapeutics throughout the healthcare system. The radiology community has been developing diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) tools over the past 20 years, long before AI became fashionable in the public press. Currently, there are approximately four hundred Food and Drug Administration approved imaging AI products. However, the clinical adoption of these products in radiology has been relatively dismal, indicating that the current technology-push model needs to evolve into the demand-pull model. We will review the current state of AI use in radiology from the perspective of clinical adoption and explore the ways in which AI products will become an ensemble of critically important tools to help radiology transition from volume-based service to value-based healthcare. This transition will create new demands for AI technologies. We contrast the current “technology-push” model with a “demand-pull” model that will aligns technology with user priorities. We summarize the lessons learned from AI experience over the past twenty years, mainly working with computer-aided detection for breast cancers and lung cancers. The radiology community calls for AI tools that can do more than detection with increasing attention toward higher workflow efficiency and higher productivity of radiologists. Major radiological societies of North America and Europe promulgated the emerging concept of value-based radiology service, an integral part of overall value-based healthcare. The transition to value-based radiology will happen and that higher value will come from the effective use of AI throughout the radiology workflow. The value-based radiology will need to work with a full range of machine learning tools, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, as well as natural language processing and large language models (e.g., chatbots). The engineering community is rapidly developing many concepts and sophisticated software tools for data orchestration, AI orchestration, and automation orchestration. Current radiology operation has been supported by PACS, a monolithic IT infrastructure of past generations. This system will need to migrate to an intelligence management system to support the new workflow needed for high value radiology.",

        "abstract": "Objective assessment of the motor evaluation test for Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis is an open issue both for clinical and technical experts since it could improve current clinical practice with benefits both for patients and healthcare systems. In this work, a wearable system composed of four inertial devices (two SensHand and two SensFoot), and related processing algorithms for extracting parameters from limbs motion was tested on 40 healthy subjects and 40 PD patients. Seventy-eight and 96 kinematic parameters were measured from lower and upper limbs, respectively. Statistical and correlation analysis allowed to define four datasets that were used to train and test five supervised learning classifiers. Excellent discrimination between the two groups was obtained with all the classifiers (average accuracy ranging from 0.936 to 0.960) and all the datasets (average accuracy ranging from 0.953 to 0.966), over three conditions that included parameters derived from lower, upper or all limbs. The best performances (accuracy = 1.00) were obtained when classifying all the limbs with linear support vector machine (SVM) or gaussian SVM. Even if further studies should be done, the current results are strongly promising to improve this system as a support tool for clinicians in objectifying PD diagnosis and monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) technique behind the most existing abilities fields in several areas like languages processing, robotics, including medicine. The most important medical applications are the early prediction system for heart diseases especially, coronary artery disease (CAD) also called atherosclerosis. The need for a medical diagnosis support system is to detect atherosclerosis at the earlier stages to optimize the diagnosis, avoid the advanced cases, and reduce treatment costs. Here, a supervised machine learning medical diagnosis support system (MDSS) for atherosclerosis prediction is presented that is able to obtain and learn automatically knowledge from each patient’s clinical data. Therefore, we used the various ML classifiers for the proposed medical diagnosis support system for atherosclerosis. Two supervised ML algorithms (Artificial Neural Network and Adaptive Boosting) were used in order to compare which one is more efficient for atherosclerosis diagnosis. Thus, this work is accomplished using databases collected from the UCI repository (Cleveland, Hungarian) and Sani Z-Alizadeh dataset. The performance metrics were computed utilizing Recall, Accuracy and Precision. Furthermore and F1 score measures were also calculated to greatly increase the proposed system performance. Consequently, the proposed model can be used to support healthcare and facilitate large-scale clinical diagnostic of atherosclerosis diseases.",

        "abstract": "Multi-instance learning (MIL) is an area of machine learning that handles data that is organized into sets of instances known as bags. Traditionally, MIL is used in the supervised-learning setting and is able to classify bags which can contain any number of instances. This property allows MIL to be naturally applied to solve the problems in a wide variety of real-world applications from computer vision to healthcare. However, many traditional MIL algorithms do not scale efficiently to large datasets. In this paper we present a novel Primal-Dual Multi-Instance Support Vector Machine (pdMISVM) derivation and implementation that can operate efficiently on large scale data. Our method relies on an algorithm derived using a multi-block variation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The approach presented in this work is able to scale to large-scale data since it avoids iteratively solving quadratic programming problems which are generally used to optimize MIL algorithms based on SVMs. In addition, we modify our derivation to include an additional optimization designed to avoid solving a least-squares problem during our algorithm; this optimization increases the utility of our approach to handle a large number of features as well as bags. Finally, we apply our approach to synthetic and real-world multi-instance datasets to illustrate the scalability, promising predictive performance, and interpretability of our proposed method. We end our discussion with an extension of our approach to handle non-linear decision boundaries. Code and data for our methods are available online at: https://github.com/minds-mines/pdMISVM.jl.",

        "abstract": "More than 10.7% of people aged 65 and older are affected by Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial as most Alzheimer's patients are unaware of having it until the effects become detrimental. AI has been known to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose Alzheimer's. However, models which produce low rates of false diagnoses are critical to prevent unnecessary treatments. Thus, we trained supervised Random Forest models with segmented brain volumes and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) outputs to classify different Alzheimer's stages. We then applied out-of-distribution (OOD) detection to the CNN model, enabling it to report OOD if misclassification is likely, thereby reducing false diagnoses. With an accuracy of 98% for detection and 95% for classification, our model based on CNN results outperformed our segmented volume model, which had detection and classification accuracies of 93% and 87%, respectively. Applying OOD detection to the CNN model enabled it to flag brain tumor images as OOD with 96% accuracy and minimal overall accuracy reduction. By using OOD detection to enhance the reliability of MRI classification using CNNs, we lowered the rate of false positives and eliminated a significant disadvantage of using Machine Learning models for healthcare tasks.

        "title": "Web-based Long-term Spine Treatment Outcome Forecasting",
        "abstract": "The aging of global population is witnessing increasing prevalence of spinal disorders. According to latest statistics, nearly five percent of the global population is suffering from spinal disorders. To relieve the pain, many spine patients tend to choose surgeries. However, recent evidences reveal that some spine patients can self-heal over time with nonoperative treatment and even surgeries may not ease the pain for some others, which raises a critical question regarding the appropriateness of such surgeries. Furthermore, the complex and time-consuming diagnostic process places a great burden on both clinicians and patients. Due to the development of web technology, it is possible for spine patients to obtain decision making suggestions on the Internet. The uniqueness of web technology, including its popularity, convenience, and immediacy, makes intelligent healthcare techniques, especially Treatment Outcome Forecasting (TOF), able to support clinical decision-making for doctors and healthcare providers. Despite a few machine-learning-based methods have been proposed for TOF, their performance and feasibility are mostly unsatisfactory due to the neglect of a few practical challenges (caused by applying on the Internet), including biased data selection, noisy supervision, and patient noncompliance. In light of this, we propose DeepTOF, a novel end-to-end deep learning model to cope with the unique challenges in web-based long-term continuous spine TOF. In particular, we combine different patient groups and train a unified predictive model to eliminate the data selection bias. Towards robust learning, we further take advantage of indirect but fine-grained supervision signals to mutually calibrate with the noisy training labels. Additionally, a feature selector was co-trained with DeepTOF to select the most important features (i.e., answers/indicators that need to be collected) for inference, thus easing the use of DeepTOF during web-based real-world application. The proposed DeepTOF could bring great benefits to the rehabilitation of spine patients. Comprehensive experiments and analysis show that DeepTOF outperforms conventional solutions by a large margin.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Given the recent impressive digital transformation worldwide, the importance of data has reached a new dimension. It is, therefore, provocative to ask whether data can save healthcare systems from bankruptcy. Areas covered: We reviewed published examples in the search for the evidence on how the growing amount of data could change the way we used to assess the value of healthcare technologies, ensuring a more holistic approach in the decision-making process while reducing the waste in the healthcare. Expert opinion: The growing amount of data will continue to provide a multitude of valuable insights that can save healthcare systems from bankruptcy. Electronic medical records, IoT, wearables, and mobile applications generate constant data streams that can be utilized endlessly thanks to methodological advancements such as SNA, unsupervised and supervised machine learning, and natural language programming. However, interoperability across these multiple data sources still pose a challenge for the future development of data-driven healthcare. Already today however, decision makers can utilize Big Data to develop conditional coverage schemes for very expensive and complicated health technologies suitable for personalized healthcare. More advanced payers may utilize even data analytics even further and develop AI-based pricing schemes.",

        "abstract": "In clinical settings, Human-computer systems need to be designed in a way that medical errors are reduced and patient care is enhanced. Inspection methods are usually employed in HCI to assess usability of interactive systems. However, they do not consider the state of the operator while executing a task, the surrounding environment and the task demands. It is argued that assessing performance of operators is fundamental for designing optimal systems with which healthcare can be effectively delivered. The aim of our solution is to assess performance of operators employing the notion of Mental Workload (MWL) this being a construct believed to strongly correlate with performance. The proposal is to develop a model for MWL assessment using supervised machine learning. This model will be evaluated via user studies involving clinicians and operators interacting with a set of medical systems. Assessments of MWL will be compared and validated with objective indexes of performance such as error rate and task execution time.",

        "title": "Automating Risk of Bias Assessment for Clinical Trials",
        "abstract": "Systematic reviews, which summarize the entirety of the evidence pertaining to a specific clinical question, have become critical for evidence-based decision making in healthcare. But such reviews have become increasingly onerous to produce due to the exponentially expanding biomedical literature base. This study proposes a step toward mitigating this problem by automating risk of bias assessment in systematic reviews, in which reviewers determine whether study results may be affected by biases (e.g., poor randomization or blinding). Conducting risk of bias assessment is an important but onerous task. We thus describe a machine learning approach to automate this assessment, using the standard Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool which assesses seven common types of bias. Training such a system would typically require a large labeled corpus, which would be prohibitively expensive to collect here. Instead, we use distant supervision, using data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (a large repository of systematic reviews), to pseudoannotate a corpus of 2200 clinical trial reports in PDF format. We then develop a joint model which, using the full text of a clinical trial report as input, predicts the risks of bias while simultaneously extracting the text fragments supporting these assessments. This study represents a step toward automating or semiautomating extraction of data necessary for the synthesis of clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Objective To examine the predictive attributes for accidental falls in community-dwelling older people in Hong Kong using decision tree analysis. Methods We recruited 1151 participants with an average age of 74.8 years by convenience sampling from a primary healthcare setting to carry out the cross-sectional study over 6 months. The whole dataset was divided into two sets, namely training set and test set, which respectively occupied 70% and 30% of the whole dataset. The training dataset was used first; decision tree analysis was used to identify possible stratifying variables that could help to generate separate decision models. Results The number of fallers was 230 with 20% 1-year prevalence. There were significant differences in gender, use of walking aids, presence of chronic diseases, and co-morbidities including osteoporosis, depression, and previous upper limb fractures, and performance in the Timed Up and Go test and the Functional Reach test among the baselines between the faller and non-faller groups. Three decision tree models for the dependent dichotomous variables (fallers, indoor fallers, and outdoor fallers) were generated, with overall accuracy rates of the models of 77.40%, 89.44% and 85.76%, respectively. Timed Up and Go, Functional Reach, body mass index, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and number of drugs taken were identified as stratifying variables in the decision tree models for fall screening. Conclusion The use of decision tree analysis for clinical algorithms for accidental falls in community-dwelling older people creates patterns for decision-making in fall screening, which also paves the way for utility-based decision-making using supervised machine learning in fall risk detection.",

        "abstract": "Day by day innovation in wireless communications and micro-technology has evolved in the development of wireless sensor networks. This technology has applications such as healthcare supervision, home security, battlefield surveillance and many more. However, due to the use of small batteries with low power this technology faces the issue of power and target monitoring. There is much research done to overcome these issues with the development of different architecture and algorithms. In this paper, a scheduling machine learning algorithm called adaptive learning automata algorithm(ALAA) is used. It provides an efficient scheduling technique. Such that each sensor node in the network has been equipped with learning automata, and with this, they can select their proper state at any given time. The state of the sensor is either active or sleep. For the experiment, different parameters are used to check the consistency of the algorithm to schedule the sensor node such that it can cover all the targets with the use of less power. The results obtained from the experiments show that the proposed algorithm is an efficient way to schedule the sensor nodes to monitor all the targets with use of less power. On the whole, this paper manages to achieve its goal by contributing to the related research on wireless sensor networks with a new design of a learning automata scheduling algorithm. The ability of this proposed algorithm to use the minimum number of sensors to be in active state verified to reduce the use of power in the network. Thus, achieving the goal by enhancing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks.",

        "title": "AI for radiographic COVID-19 detection selects shortcuts over signal",
        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and radiologists have recently reported AI systems that accurately detect COVID-19 in chest radiographs. However, the robustness of these systems remains unclear. Using state-of-the-art techniques in explainable AI, we demonstrate that recent deep learning systems to detect COVID-19 from chest radiographs rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology, creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. We observe that the approach to obtain training data for these AI systems introduces a nearly ideal scenario for AI to learn these spurious ‘shortcuts’. Because this approach to data collection has also been used to obtain training data for the detection of COVID-19 in computed tomography scans and for medical imaging tasks related to other diseases, our study reveals a far-reaching problem in medical-imaging AI. In addition, we show that evaluation of a model on external data is insufficient to ensure AI systems rely on medically relevant pathology, because the undesired ‘shortcuts’ learned by AI systems may not impair performance in new hospitals. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI should be seen as a prerequisite to clinical deployment of machine-learning healthcare models. The urgency of the developing COVID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of novel diagnostic approaches, many of which use machine learning. DeGrave and colleagues use explainable AI techniques to analyse a selection of these approaches and find that the methods frequently learn to identify features unrelated to the actual disease.",

        "title": "Coping with Mistreatment in Fair Algorithms",
        "abstract": "Machine learning actively impacts our everyday life in almost all endeavors and domains such as healthcare, finance, and energy. As our dependence on the machine learning increases, it is inevitable that these algorithms will be used to make decisions that will have a direct impact on the society spanning all resolutions from personal choices to world-wide policies. Hence, it is crucial to ensure that (un)intentional bias does not affect the machine learning algorithms especially when they are required to take decisions that may have unintended consequences. Algorithmic fairness techniques have found traction in the machine learning community and many methods and metrics have been proposed to ensure and evaluate fairness in algorithms and data collection. In this paper, we study the algorithmic fairness in a supervised learning setting and examine the effect of optimizing a classifier for the Equal Opportunity metric. We demonstrate that such a classifier has an increased false positive rate across sensitive groups and propose a conceptually simple method to mitigate this bias. We rigorously analyze the proposed method and evaluate it on several real world datasets demonstrating its efficacy.

        "abstract": "The future of healthcare may look completely different from the current clinic-center services.  Rapidly growing and developing technologies are expected to change clinics throughout the world. However, the healthcare delivered to impaired patients, such as elderly and disabled people, possibly still requires hands-on human expertise. The aim of this study is to propose a predictive model that pre-diagnose illnesses by analyzing symptoms that are interactively taken from patients via several hand gestures during a period of time. This is particularly helpful in assisting clinicians and doctors to gain better understanding and make more accurate decisions about future plans for their patients’ situations. The hand gestures are detected, the time of the gesture is recorded and then they are associated to their designated symptoms. This information is captured in the form of provenance graphs constructed based on the W3C PROV data model. The provenance graph is analyzed by extracting several network metrics and then supervised machine-learning algorithms are used to build a predictive model. The model is used to predict diseases from the symptoms with a maximum accuracy of 84.5%.",

A significant amount of research has been done on healthcare systems based on supervised learning. In this study, we present a generalized solution to detect visually observable symptoms on faces using semi-supervised anomaly detection combined with machine vision algorithms. We rely on the disease-related statistical facts to detect abnormalities and classify them into multiple categories to narrow down the possible medical reasons of detecting. Our method is in contrast with most existing approaches, which are limited by the availability of labeled training data required for supervised learning, and therefore offers the major advantage of flagging any unusual and visually observable symptoms.",

In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. In particular, training a LapSVM in the primal can be efficiently performed with preconditioned conjugate gradient. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. The computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n3) to O(kn2), where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples and k is empirically evaluated to be significantly smaller than n. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large data sets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on real world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach.",

        "title": "Utilizing Chinese Admission Records for MACE Prediction of Acute Coronary Syndrome",
        "abstract": "Background: Clinical major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) prediction of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is important for a number of applications including physician decision support, quality of care assessment, and efficient healthcare service delivery on ACS patients. Admission records, as typical media to contain clinical information of patients at the early stage of their hospitalizations, provide significant potential to be explored for MACE prediction in a proactive manner. Methods: We propose a hybrid approach for MACE prediction by utilizing a large volume of admission records. Firstly, both a rule-based medical language processing method and a machine learning method (i.e., Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)) are developed to extract essential patient features from unstructured admission records. After that, state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms are applied to construct MACE prediction models from data. Results: We comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a real clinical dataset consisting of 2930 ACS patient samples collected from a Chinese hospital. Our best model achieved 72% AUC in MACE prediction. In comparison of the performance between our models and two well-known ACS risk score tools, i.e., GRACE and TIMI, our learned models obtain better performances with a significant margin. Conclusions: Experimental results reveal that our approach can obtain competitive performance in MACE prediction. The comparison of classifiers indicates the proposed approach has a competitive generality with datasets extracted by different feature extraction methods. Furthermore, our MACE prediction model obtained a significant improvement by comparison with both GRACE and TIMI. It indicates that using admission records can effectively provide MACE prediction service for ACS patients at the early stage of their hospitalizations.",

Neural networks (NN), also known as artificial neural networks or simulated neural networks, are the base for ML and DL. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another. ML, one of the algorithms of AI, allows the machine to resolve problems in a manner similar to that followed by the human brain.2 In particular, it “relies on statistical methods to detect hidden patterns within a dataset and improve performance with experience.”1 DL is one of the ML techniques. It mimics the ability of the human brain in data processing in order to assist humans in making decisions, upgrading precision medicines, and improving drug discovery; “it can also work and suggest an output without human supervision.”2 Figure 1 shows the applications of AI, ML, and DL “to solve healthcare-related issues and to predict optimal treatment and outcome.”2",

Internet of Things solutions require careful management of devices and the risk mitigation of potential vulnerabilities within cyber-physical systems. The Internet of Things concept, its implementations, and applications are frequently discussed on social media platforms. This research illuminates the public view of the Internet of Things through a content-based and network analysis of contemporary conversations occurring on the Twitter platform. Tweets can be analyzed with machine learning methods to converge the volume and variety of conversations into predictive and descriptive models. We have reviewed 684,503 tweets collected in a 2-week period. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we have identified trends within the realm of IoT and their interconnecting relationships between the most mentioned industries. We have identified characteristics of language sentiment which can help to predict the popularity of IoT conversation topics. We found the healthcare industry as the leading use case industry for IoT implementations. This is not surprising as the current COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant social media discussions. There was an alarming dearth of conversations towards cybersecurity. Recent breaches and ransomware events denote that organizations should spend more time communicating about risks and mitigations. Only 12% of the tweets relating to the Internet of Things contained any mention of topics such as encryption, vulnerabilities, or risk, among other cybersecurity-related terms. We propose an IoT Cybersecurity Communication Scorecard to help organizations benchmark the density and sentiment of their corporate communications regarding security against their specific industry.",

These applications are multidisciplinary including robotics, computer vision, safety, and animal healthcare. The appearance of RGB-D sensors such as Microsoft Kinect and its successful applications in tracking and recognition made this area of research more active, especially with their affordable price. In this paper, a data synthesis approach for generating realistic and highly varied animal corpus is presented. The generated dataset is used to train a machine learning model to semantically segment animal body parts. In the proposed framework, foreground extraction is applied to segment the animal, dense representations are obtained using the depth comparison feature extractor and used for training a supervised random decision forest. An accurate pixel-wise classification of the parts will allow accurate joint localization and hence pose estimation. Our approach records classification accuracy of 93% in identifying the different body parts of an animal using RGB-D images.",

        "title": "Neural Language Models with Distant Supervision to Identify Major Depressive Disorder from Clinical Notes",
        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder that is associated with significant healthcare burden worldwide. Phenotyping of MDD can help early diagnosis and consequently may have significant advantages in patient management. In prior research MDD phenotypes have been extracted from structured Electronic Health Records (EHR) or using Electroencephalographic (EEG) data with traditional machine learning models to predict MDD phenotypes. However, MDD phenotypic information is also documented in free-text EHR data, such as clinical notes. While clinical notes may provide more accurate phenotyping information, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms must be developed to abstract such information. Recent advancements in NLP resulted in state-of-the-art neural language models, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers (BERT) model, which is a transformer-based model that can be pre-trained from a corpus of unsupervised text data and then fine-tuned on specific tasks. However, such neural language models have been underutilized in clinical NLP tasks due to the lack of large training datasets. In the literature, researchers have utilized the distant supervision paradigm to train machine learning models on clinical text classification tasks to mitigate the issue of lacking annotated training data. It is still unknown whether the paradigm is effective for neural language models. In this paper, we propose to leverage the neural language models in a distant supervision paradigm to identify MDD phenotypes from clinical notes. The experimental results indicate that our proposed approach is effective in identifying MDD phenotypes and that the Bio- Clinical BERT, a specific BERT model for clinical data, achieved the best performance in comparison with conventional machine learning models.",

        "title": "Deep Neural Networks and Tabular Data: A Survey",
        "abstract": "Heterogeneous tabular data are the most commonly used form of data and are essential for numerous critical and computationally demanding applications. On homogeneous datasets, deep neural networks have repeatedly shown excellent performance and have therefore been widely adopted. However, their adaptation to tabular data for inference or data generation tasks remains highly challenging. To facilitate further progress in the field, this work provides an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for tabular data. We categorize these methods into three groups: data transformations, specialized architectures, and regularization models. For each of these groups, our work offers a comprehensive overview of the main approaches. Moreover, we discuss deep learning approaches for generating tabular data and also provide an overview over strategies for explaining deep models on tabular data. Thus, our first contribution is to address the main research streams and existing methodologies in the mentioned areas while highlighting relevant challenges and open research questions. Our second contribution is to provide an empirical comparison of traditional machine learning methods with 11 deep learning approaches across five popular real-world tabular datasets of different sizes and with different learning objectives. Our results, which we have made publicly available as competitive benchmarks, indicate that algorithms based on gradient-boosted tree ensembles still mostly outperform deep learning models on supervised learning tasks, suggesting that the research progress on competitive deep learning models for tabular data is stagnating. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth overview of deep learning approaches for tabular data; as such, this work can serve as a valuable starting point to guide researchers and practitioners interested in deep learning with tabular data.",

        "abstract": "The aim was to create an algorithm to transform self-reported outcomes from a stroke register to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Two stroke registers were used: the Väststroke, a local register in Gothenburg, Sweden, and the Riksstroke, a Swedish national register. The reference variable, mRS (from Väststroke), was mapped with seven self-reported questions from Riksstroke. The transformation algorithm was created as a result of manual mapping performed by healthcare professionals. A supervised machine learning method—decision tree—was used to further evaluate the transformation algorithm. Of 1145 patients, 54% were male, the mean age was 71 y. The mRS grades 0, 1 and 2 could not be distinguished as a result of manual mapping or by using the decision tree analysis. Thus, these grades were merged. With manual mapping, 78% of the patients were correctly classified, and the level of agreement was almost perfect, weighted Kappa (Kw) was 0.81. With the decision tree, 80% of the patients were correctly classified, and substantial agreement was achieved, Kw = 0.67. The self-reported outcomes from a stroke register can be transformed to the mRS. A mRS algorithm based on manual mapping might be useful for researchers using self-reported questionnaire data.",

        "title": "Personalized Nutrition—Genes, Diet, and Related Interactive Parameters as Predictors of Cancer in Multiethnic Colorectal Cancer Families",
        "abstract": "To personalize nutrition, the purpose of this study was to examine five key genes in the folate metabolism pathway, and dietary parameters and related interactive parameters as predictors of colorectal cancer (CRC) by measuring the healthy eating index (HEI) in multiethnic families. The five genes included methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 and 1298, methionine synthase (MTR) 2756, methionine synthase reductase (MTRR 66), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 19bp, and they were used to compute a total gene mutation score. We included 53 families, 53 CRC patients and 53 paired family friend members of diverse population groups in Southern California. We measured multidimensional data using the ensemble bootstrap forest method to identify variables of importance within domains of genetic, demographic, and dietary parameters to achieve dimension reduction. We then constructed predictive generalized regression (GR) modeling with a supervised machine learning validation procedure with the target variable (cancer status) being specified to validate the results to allow enhanced prediction and reproducibility. The results showed that the CRC group had increased total gene mutation scores compared to the family members (p < 0.05). Using the Akaike’s information criterion and Leave-One-Out cross validation GR methods, the HEI was interactive with thiamine (vitamin B1), which is a new finding for the literature. The natural food sources for thiamine include whole grains, legumes, and some meats and fish which HEI scoring included as part of healthy portions (versus limiting portions on salt, saturated fat and empty calories). Additional predictors included age, as well as gender and the interaction of MTHFR 677 with overweight status (measured by body mass index) in predicting CRC, with the cancer group having more men and overweight cases. The HEI score was significant when split at the median score of 77 into greater or less scores, confirmed through the machine-learning recursive tree method and predictive modeling, although an HEI score of greater than 80 is the US national standard set value for a good diet. The HEI and healthy eating are modifiable factors for healthy living in relation to dietary parameters and cancer prevention, and they can be used for personalized nutrition in the precision-based healthcare era.",

        "title": "Mammogram Classification and Abnormality Detection from Nonlocal Labels using Deep Multiple Instance Neural Network",
        "abstract": "Mammography is the common modality used for screening and early detection of breast cancer. The emergence of machine learning, particularly deep learning methods, aims to assist radiologists to reach higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Yet, typical supervised machine learning methods demand the radiological images to have ﬁndings annotated within the image. This is a tedious task, which is often out of reach due to the high cost and unavailability of expert radiologists. We describe a computer-aided detection and diagnosis system for weakly supervised learning, where the mammogram (MG) images are tagged only on a global level, without local annotations. Our work addresses the problem of MG classiﬁcation and detection of abnormal ﬁndings through a novel deep learning framework built on the multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm. Our proposed method processes the MG image utilizing the full resolution, with a deep MIL convolutional neural network. This approach allows us to classify the whole MG according to a severity score and localize the source of abnormality in full resolution, while trained on a weakly labeled data set. The key hallmark of our approach is automatic discovery of the discriminating patches in the mammograms using MIL. We validate the proposed method on two mammogram data sets, a large multi-center MG cohort and the publicly available INbreast, in two different scenarios. We present promising results in classiﬁcation and detection, comparable to a recent supervised method that was trained on fully annotated data set. As the volume and complexity of data in healthcare continues to increase, such an approach may have a profound impact on patient care in many applications.",

        "title": "Hyper Parameter Tuned Ensemble Approach for Gestational Diabetes Prediction",
        "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus is commonly found in human beings around the world and this is one of the serious diseases which causes boundless suffering among patients. There are numerous reasons for the prevalence of this disease. It would be better to consider the predictions carried out earlier in this respect, since diabetes is a non - communicable disease and makes a great impact on the health condition of people nowadays. This is the reason why the existing medicinal practices in most hospitals are collecting patients' life history or the record of the disease. This is done for diagnosing diabetes using various medical tests followed by proper treatment for the disease. Machine learning provides an immense contribution to the sector of healthcare. For this research, Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, obtained from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning source that included 768 patients' details along with nine attributes had been chosen for a comprehensive investigation of this grave and widespread problem in the health sector. Eventually, an adequate perfect outcome could be achieved and some effective and transparent conclusions were made. Among 768 diabetics, 500 were recognized as positive for the disease while 268 were recognized as negative. Besides, the recorded facts were put into particular supervised machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR) and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). Along with this, bagging and boosting techniques like Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), LightGBM, and CatBoost too were taken into consideration. In addition, by considering classifiers with the highest accuracies, the final ensemble model was developed with the adaption of SVM, CatBoost and RF to predict the diabetes mellitus. Thus, the model resulted in an accuracy of 86.15%.",

        "title": "Improved Intrusion Detection System using Quantal Response Equilibrium-based Game Model and Rule-based Classification",
        "abstract": "Wireless sensor network has large number of low-cost tiny nodes with sensing capability.  These provide low cost solutions to many real world problems such as such as defence, Internet of things, healthcare, environment monitoring and so on. The sensor nodes of these networks are placed in vulnerable environment. Hence, the security of these networks is very important. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays an important role in providing a security to such type of networks. The sensor nodes of the network have limited power and, traditional security mechanisms such as key-management, encryption decryption and authentication techniques cannot be installed on the nodes. Hence, there is a need of special security mechanism to handle the intrusions. In this paper, intrusion detection system is designed and implemented using game theory and machine learning to identify multiple attacks. Game theory is designed and used to apply the IDS optimally in WSN. The game model is designed by defining the players and the corresponding strategies. Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) concept of game theory is used to select the strategies in optimal way for the intrusion’s detection. Further, these intrusions are classified as denial of service attack, rank attack or selective forwarding attacks using supervised machine learning technique based on different parameters and rules. Results show that all the attacks are detected with good detection rate and the proposed approach provides optimal usage of IDS.",

        "title": "Cloud Computing Based Systems for Healthcare",
        "abstract": "The emergence of cloud computing leads to new developments for diverse application domains. This is particularly true for healthcare with its tremendous importance in today's society, thus making it worth to investigate the relevant perspectives and insights. In this special issue, readers will find the foundations together with cutting-edge developments in the state-of-the-art of cloud computing based systems for healthcare. \n \nCloud computing is getting increasing attention and represents nowadays one of the most important research topics in computing science and information systems. Cloud computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware and software systems within the data centers which provide those services. Cloud is now seen as a valid strategy and specific applications based on these technologies have become widespread. \n \nHealthcare, as with any other service operation, has been impacted by the cloud computing phenomenon with the literature reporting both benefits and challenges of cloud computing in the area. However, the evolving nature of science and technology creates new scenarios that must be studied using interdisciplinary and holistic means. \n \nThe aim of this special issue was to collect innovative and high-quality research contributions regarding the advances in the healthcare domain that are enabled by the use of cloud computing architectures and techniques. The focus is intended to be integral for cloud computing in healthcare, but emphasizing not only the IT side of the phenomenon but also the managerial and the health practitioner side. \n \nEditors received a considerable amount of submissions that were peer-reviewed by top experts in the field. Based on the reviews and our reading of the papers, editors selected seven high-quality ones to be published. Contributions of these papers are summarized as follows. \n \nTwo contributions deal with scenarios where cloud computing can serve as an enabler for improved decision making and contribute to systemic improvements in healthcare domain. In “Usalpharma: a cloud-based architecture to support Quality Assurance training processes in health area using Virtual Worlds” by F. J. Garcia-Penalvo et al., the authors discuss ways cloud-based architectures can extend and enhance the functionality of training environments based on Virtual Worlds with focus on training processes in Quality Assurance for pharmaceutical laboratories. In “Cloud based meta-learning system for predictive modeling of biomedical data” by M. Vukicevic et al., the authors propose a cloud-based system that integrates a meta-learning framework for ranking and selection of the best predictive algorithms for data at hand and open-source big data technologies for analysis of biomedical data. \n \nTwo contributions focus on the topics of risk and security as management issues in cloud computing based systems for healthcare. In “Proposal for a security management in cloud computing for health care” K. by Haufe et al., the authors propose a framework that aims to cover the most important security processes related to cloud computing in the healthcare sector. The approach considers both the standards of the ISO 27000 family, as well as specific aspects of healthcare organizations using cloud computing. In “Risks and crises for healthcare providers: the impact of cloud computing” by R. Glasberg et al., the multidisciplinary team of authors analyze risks and crises for healthcare providers and discuss the impact of cloud computing in such scenarios. \n \nThree contributions deal with specific healthcare-related use cases of cloud computing in diverse application scenarios. In “SAMuS: service-oriented architecture for multisensor surveillance in smart homes,” S. Van Hoecke et al. present the design of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for multisensor surveillance in smart homes. The solution is evaluated by building a smart Kinect sensor that is able to dynamically switch between IR and RGB and improves person detection by incorporating feedback from pressure sensors within the SOA. In “A cloud-based X73 ubiquitous mobile healthcare system: design and implementation” by Z. Ji et al., a ubiquitous mobile healthcare uHealth system is presented. It is based on the ISO/IEEE11073 personal health data (PHD) standards (X73) and cloud computing techniques. In “An expert fitness diagnosis system based on elastic cloud computing,” K. C. Tseng et al. describe an expert diagnosis system based on cloud computing that is able to classify a user's fitness level based on supervised machine learning techniques. This system uses parameters such as user's physiological data, age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) and utilizes an elastic algorithm based on Poisson distribution to allocate computation resources dynamically. \n \nThe special issue editors would like to take this opportunity to thank the authors for their papers and the reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions. Special thanks also to the editorial team for its help and also for providing us an opportunity to edit this special issue.",

        "title": "Human Recognition using Single-Input-Single-Output Channel Model and Support Vector Machines",
        "abstract": "WiFi based human motion recognition systems mainly rely on the availability of Channel State Information (CSI). Embedded within WiFi devices, the present radio subsystems can output CSI that describes the response of a wireless communication channel. Radio subsystems as such, use complex hardware architectures that consume lots of energy during data transmission, as well as exhibit phase drift in the sub-carriers. Although human motion recognition (HMR) based on multicarrier transmission systems show better classification accuracy, transmission of multiple sub-carriers results in an increase in the overall energy consumption at the transmitter. Apparently CSI based systems can be perceived as process intensive and power hungry devices. To alleviate the process intensive computing and reduce energy consumption in WiFi, this study proposes a human recognition system that uses only one radio carrier frequency. The study uses two software defined radios and a machine learning classifier to identify four humans, and the study results show that human identification is possible with 99% accuracy using only one radio carrier. The results of this study will have an impact on the development process of smart sensing systems, particularly those that relate to healthcare, authentication, and passive monitoring and sensing.

        "title": "eGAP: An Evolutionary Game Theoretic Approach to Random Forest Pruning",
        "abstract": "To make healthcare available and easily accessible, the Internet of Things (IoT), which paved the way to the construction of smart cities, marked the birth of many smart applications in numerous areas, including healthcare. As a result, smart healthcare applications have been and are being developed to provide, using mobile and electronic technology, higher diagnosis quality of the diseases, better treatment of the patients, and improved quality of lives. Since smart healthcare applications that are mainly concerned with the prediction of healthcare data (like diseases for example) rely on predictive healthcare data analytics, it is imperative for such predictive healthcare data analytics to be as accurate as possible. In this paper, we will exploit supervised machine learning methods in classification and regression to improve the performance of the traditional Random Forest on healthcare datasets, both in terms of accuracy and classification/regression speed, in order to produce an effective and efficient smart healthcare application, which we have termed eGAP. eGAP uses the evolutionary game theoretic approach replicator dynamics to evolve a Random Forest ensemble. Trees of high resemblance in an initial Random Forest are clustered, and then clusters grow and shrink by adding and removing trees using replicator dynamics, according to the predictive accuracy of each subforest represented by a cluster of trees. All clusters have an initial number of trees that is equal to the number of trees in the smallest cluster. Cluster growth is performed using trees that are not initially sampled. The speed and accuracy of the proposed method have been demonstrated by an experimental study on 10 classification and 10 regression medical datasets.",

        "abstract": "The widespread influence of social media impacts every aspect of life, including the healthcare sector. Although medics and health professionals are the final decision makers, the advice and recommendations obtained from fellow patients are significant. In this context, the present paper explores the topics of discussion posted by breast cancer patients and survivors on online forums. The study examines an online forum, Breastcancer.org, maps the discussion entries to several topics, and proposes a machine learning model based on a classification algorithm to characterize the topics. To explore the topics of breast cancer patients and survivors, approximately 1000 posts are selected and manually labeled with annotations. In contrast, millions of posts are available to build the labels. A semi-supervised learning technique is used to build the labels for the unlabeled data; hence, the large data are classified using a deep learning algorithm. The deep learning algorithm BiLSTM with BERT word embedding technique provided a better f1-score of 79.5%. This method is able to classify the following topics: medication reviews, clinician knowledge, various treatment options, seeking and providing support, diagnostic procedures, financial issues and implications for everyday life. What matters the most for the patients is coping with everyday living as well as seeking and providing emotional and informational support. The approach and findings show the potential of studying social media to provide insight into patients' experiences with cancer like critical health problems.",

        "title": "Artificial-Intelligence-Based Prediction of Clinical Events among Hemodialysis Patients Using Non-Contact Sensor Data",
        "abstract": "Non-contact sensors are gaining popularity in clinical settings to monitor the vital parameters of patients. In this study, we used a non-contact sensor device to monitor vital parameters like the heart rate, respiration rate, and heart rate variability of hemodialysis (HD) patients for a period of 23 weeks during their HD sessions. During these 23 weeks, a total number of 3237 HD sessions were observed. Out of 109 patients enrolled in the study, 78 patients reported clinical events such as muscle spasms, inpatient stays, emergency visits or even death during the study period. We analyzed the sensor data of these two groups of patients, namely an event and no-event group. We found a statistically significant difference in the heart rates, respiration rates, and some heart rate variability parameters among the two groups of patients when their means were compared using an independent sample t-test. We further developed a supervised machine-learning-based prediction model to predict event or no-event based on the sensor data and demographic information. A mean area under curve (ROC AUC) of 90.16% with 96.21% mean precision, and 88.47% mean recall was achieved. Our findings point towards the novel use of non-contact sensors in clinical settings to monitor the vital parameters of patients and the further development of early warning solutions using artificial intelligence (AI) for the prediction of clinical events. These models could assist healthcare professionals in taking decisions and designing better care plans for patients by early detecting changes to vital parameters.",

        "title": "Using artificial intelligence to reduce diagnostic workload without compromising detection of urinary tract infections",
        "abstract": "BackgroundA substantial proportion of microbiological screening in diagnostic laboratories is due to suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs), yet approximately two thirds of urine samples typically yield negative culture results. By reducing the number of query samples to be cultured and enabling diagnostic services to concentrate on those in which there are true microbial infections, a significant improvement in efficiency of the service is possible.MethodologyScreening process for urine samples prior to culture was modelled in a single clinical microbiology laboratory covering three hospitals and community services across Bristol and Bath, UK. Retrospective analysis of all urine microscopy, culture, and sensitivity reports over one year was used to compare two methods of classification: a heuristic model using a combination of white blood cell count and bacterial count, and a machine learning approach testing three algorithms (Random Forest, Neural Network, Extreme Gradient Boosting) whilst factoring in independent variables including demographics, historical urine culture results, and clinical details provided with the specimen.ResultsA total of 212,554 urine reports were analysed. Initial findings demonstrated the potential for using machine learning algorithms, which outperformed the heuristic model in terms of relative workload reduction achieved at a classification sensitivity > 95%. Upon further analysis of classification sensitivity of subpopulations, we concluded that samples from pregnant patients and children (age 11 or younger) require independent evaluation. First the removal of pregnant patients and children from the classification process was investigated but this diminished the workload reduction achieved. The optimal solution was found to be three Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms, trained independently for the classification of pregnant patients, children, and then all other patients. When combined, this system granted a relative workload reduction of 41% and a sensitivity of 95% for each of the stratified patient groups.ConclusionBased on the considerable time and cost savings achieved, without compromising the diagnostic performance, the heuristic model was successfully implemented in routine clinical practice in the diagnostic laboratory at Severn Pathology, Bristol. Our work shows the potential application of supervised machine learning models in improving service efficiency at a time when demand often surpasses resources of public healthcare providers.",

        "abstract": "For a business organization, Sentiment Analysis is a great way to understand the needs of the customers, find out whether they are happy with the product or not and which areas need an improvement. It is also used in various other fields like Healthcare to check how public feels about a specific drug and Politics to predict which party is going to win the election. In light of the current surge in interest in sentiment analysis among researchers for a range of applications, a framework for carrying out a highly accurate sentiment analysis is required. A lot of research has been done for sentiment analysis of tweets from Twitter since it helps in understanding public's view of the particular product, situation or any other topic. There are various models proposed by the researchers with which we can perform sentiment analysis but there are still many challenges that still need to be addressed as well. The presence of emoticons, spam, sarcasm and other forms of content in large number of social media posts makes the feature extraction challenging. Among the Machine Learning Algorithms, the supervised classifiers outperformed the unsupervised approaches in terms of scalability and efficiency. In this review paper, we will discuss the various ways we can perform sentiment analysis and we will also discuss the various applications and challenges of sentiment analysis as well.",

Supervised machine learning algorithms was used to formulate the predictive model for risk of thalassemia using the parameters and data identified and collected. The predictive model for the risk of thalassemia was simulated using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). The simulated model was validated using the historical data collected from the hospitals explaining the parameters and the risk of Thalassemia. The results of the study showed that following the collection of data from 51 patients, the parameters identified included demographic variables like gender, age, marital status, ethnicity and social class while the clinical variables included family history, spleen enlargement, diabetes, urine colour changes and parent carriers while the distribution of the risk was 43% no cases, 10% low cases, 16% moderate cases and 31% high cases. The study concluded that using the multi-layer perceptron for the prediction of Thalassemia will improve the decision making process within the healthcare service concerning Thalassemia.",

        "abstract": "Different aspects of the curse of dimensionality are known to present serious challenges to various machine-learning methods and tasks. This paper explores a new aspect of the dimensionality curse, referred to as hubness, that affects the distribution of k-occurrences: the number of times a point appears among the k nearest neighbors of other points in a data set. Through theoretical and empirical analysis involving synthetic and real data sets we show that under commonly used assumptions this distribution becomes considerably skewed as dimensionality increases, causing the emergence of hubs, that is, points with very high k-occurrences which effectively represent \"popular\" nearest neighbors. We examine the origins of this phenomenon, showing that it is an inherent property of data distributions in high-dimensional vector space, discuss its interaction with dimensionality reduction, and explore its influence on a wide range of machine-learning tasks directly or indirectly based on measuring distances, belonging to supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning families.",

        "title": "Accuracy Rejection Normalized-Cost Curves (ARNCCs): A Novel 3-Dimensional Framework for Robust Classification",
        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) offers several supervised learning algorithms to build classifiers for developing accurate decision support systems. However, the selection of robust classifier for reliable decision making in healthcare domain is three-fold: accuracy, refraining for low confidence decisions, and the cost of decisions. In the field of medical science, there are costs associated with the incorrect and the refraining from decisions, which can have negative implications in devising adequate therapeutic interventions. For example, it may be life threating if a cancer patient is declared as healthy one (misclassification cost) or decision remains pending for some time (rejection cost). In this work we proposed the concept of Accuracy Rejection Normalized-Cost Curves (ARNCCs), which is an extension of Accuracy Rejection Curves (ARCs); a three-dimensional visualization technique to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of classification algorithms over different rejection regions and normalized-cost (NC) to select the robust classifier. ARNCCs method holds ARCs plot on two dimensions, in addition it computes NC at third dimension against ratio of false positive costs and ratio of rejection costs obtained at different rejection rates. The proposed three-dimensional graphs have the potential to answer a variety of questions regarding accuracy, rejection rate and NC of a classifier. Six publicly available cancer datasets (four breast cancer and two lung cancer) having clinical parameters obtained from ML repository of University of California, Irvine (UCI) were used to assess the performance of proposed ARNCCs in this study. Empirical results show that ARNCCs provide broad range of decisions to choose the desired parameters (accuracy, rejection rate and NC) for further necessary actions as compared to traditional ARCs method. ARNCCs framework has the ability to more logically compare the performances of classification algorithms in terms of accuracy, rejection rate and NC based scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology has been growing at a substantial growth rate over the last decade. Introduced as the backbone of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it soon found its application in other fields because of its security and privacy features. Blockchain has been used in the healthcare industry for several purposes including secure data logging, transactions, and maintenance using smart contracts. Great work has been carried out to make blockchain smart, with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to combine the best features of the two technologies. This review incorporates the conceptual and functional aspects of the individual technologies and innovations in the domains of blockchain and artificial intelligence and lays down a strong foundational understanding of the domains individually and also rigorously discusses the various ways AI has been used along with blockchain to power the healthcare industry including areas of great importance such as electronic health record (EHR) management, distant-patient monitoring and telemedicine, genomics, drug research, and testing, specialized imaging and outbreak prediction. It compiles various algorithms from supervised and unsupervised machine learning problems along with deep learning algorithms such as convolutional/recurrent neural networks and numerous platforms currently being used in AI-powered blockchain systems and discusses their applications. The review also presents the challenges still faced by these systems which they inherit from the AI and blockchain algorithms used at the core of them and the scope of future work.",

        "title": "A Hybrid Feature Modeling Approach for Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval",
        "abstract": "With the proliferation of various imaging based diagnostic procedures in the healthcare field, patient-specific scan images constitute huge volumes of data that needs to be well-organized and managed for supporting clinical decision support applications. One such crucial application with a significant impact on point-of-care treatment quality is a Content Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) system that can assist doctors in disease diagnosis based on similar image retrieval. Medical images are multi-dimensional and often contain manifold information, due to which efficient techniques for optimal feature extraction from large-scale image collections are the need of the day. In this paper, an efficient CBMIR model is proposed that is built on multi-level feature sets extracted from medical images. Four different feature extraction techniques are used to optimally represent images in a multi-dimensional feature space, for facilitating classification using supervised machine learning algorithms and top-k similar image retrieval. Experimental validation of proposed model on the standard ImageCLEF 2009 dataset containing 12,560 X-ray images across 116 classes showed promising results in terms of classification accuracy of 85.91%.",

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence to Improve Antibiotic Prescribing: A Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Introduction: The use of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance (ABR). Different methods have been used to predict and control ABR. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored to improve antibiotic (AB) prescribing, and thereby control and reduce ABR. This review explores whether the use of AI can improve antibiotic prescribing for human patients. Methods: Observational studies that use AI to improve antibiotic prescribing were retrieved for this review. There were no restrictions on the time, setting or language. References of the included studies were checked for additional eligible studies. Two independent authors screened the studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the National Institute of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for observational cohort studies. Results: Out of 3692 records, fifteen studies were eligible for full-text screening. Five studies were included in this review, and a narrative synthesis was carried out to assess their findings. All of the studies used supervised machine learning (ML) models as a subfield of AI, such as logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting decision trees, support vector machines and K-nearest neighbours. Each study showed a positive contribution of ML in improving antibiotic prescribing, either by reducing antibiotic prescriptions or predicting inappropriate prescriptions. However, none of the studies reported the engagement of AB prescribers in developing their ML models, nor their feedback on the user-friendliness and reliability of the models in different healthcare settings. Conclusion: The use of ML methods may improve antibiotic prescribing in both primary and secondary settings. None of the studies evaluated the implementation process of their models in clinical practices. Prospero Registration: (CRD42022329049).",

        "abstract": "Length of stay in hospitalized patients is acknowledged as a critical factor for healthcare policy planning that consequently affects the available human, technical and financial resources as well as facilities occupation. Over recent years, data mining and machine learning led to the development of several efficient and accurate models for predicting of how long a patient will stay in the hospital and support healthcare policy planning. As an alternative to traditional classification methods, semi-supervised learning algorithms have become a hot topic of significant research which exhibit remarkable performance over labeled data but lack the ability to be applied on large amounts of unlabeled data. In this work, we evaluate the performance of semi-supervised methods in predicting the length of stay of hospitalized patients. Our reported experimental results illustrate that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved using few labeled data in comparison to well known supervised learning algorithms.",

        "title": "Computational Intelligence in Gait Research: A Perspective on Current Applications and Future Challenges",
        "abstract": "Our mobility is an important daily requirement so much so that any disruption to it severely degrades our perceived quality of life. Studies in gait and human movement sciences, therefore, play a significant role in maintaining the well-being of our mobility. Current gait analysis involves numerous interdependent gait parameters that are difficult to adequately interpret due to the large volume of recorded data and lengthy assessment times in gait laboratories. A proposed solution to these problems is computational intelligence (CI), which is an emerging paradigm in biomedical engineering most notably in pathology detection and prosthesis design. The integration of CI technology in gait systems facilitates studies in disorders caused by lower limb defects, cerebral disorders, and aging effects by learning data relationships through a combination of signal processing and machine learning techniques. Learning paradigms, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and fuzzy and evolutionary algorithms, provide advanced modeling capabilities for biomechanical systems that in the past have relied heavily on statistical analysis. CI offers the ability to investigate nonlinear data relationships, enhance data interpretation, design more efficient diagnostic methods, and extrapolate model functionality. These are envisioned to result in more cost-effective, efficient, and easy-to-use systems, which would address global shortages in medical personnel and rising medical costs. This paper surveys current signal processing and CI methodologies followed by gait applications ranging from normal gait studies and disorder detection to artificial gait simulation. We review recent systems focusing on the existing challenges and issues involved in making them successful. We also examine new research in sensor technologies for gait that could be combined with these intelligent systems to develop more effective healthcare solutions.",

Typical approaches to relationship extraction in this domain have used full parses, domain-specific grammars, and large knowledge bases encoding domain knowledge. In other areas of biomedical NLP, statistical machine learning approaches are now routinely applied to relationship extraction. We report on the novel application of these statistical techniques to clinical relationships. \n \nWe describe a supervised machine learning system, trained with a corpus of oncology narratives hand-annotated with clinically important relationships. Various shallow features are extracted from these texts, and used to train statistical classifiers. We compare the suitability of these features for clinical relationship extraction, how extraction varies between inter- and intra-sentential relationships, and examine the amount of training data needed to learn various relationships.",

        "abstract": "Mobile phones, currently, are one of the most extensive medium for the communication of any kind of information to the general public. Being one of the fastest spreading technologies, even to the remotest of areas, this highly sought after contemporary resource has started seeking its application in areas like healthcare, education, banking and internet crime. On this account Short Message Service via mobile phones can aid as an efficient tool to retrieve answers to various Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in multiple domains. This application of text messages using mobile phones can be quite substantial only if the limitations that occur due to the large amount of noise in the SMS text can be eliminated. The solution proposed in this paper tries to effectively denoise the text using a similarity measure that aggregates results from prefix and suffix matching and a similarity ratio. To further refine these results supervised machine learning using Naïve Bayes theorem on the N-Gram Markov model is implemented. For this we use the training database of FAQs in various domains to compute probabilities of consecutive occurrence of bigrams of words. Further, using set operations like intersection and minus the corrected query is matched in the FAQ corpus to generate the most proximate questions corresponding to it. To demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm it was experimented upon a set of queries collected from some mobile phone users and the results were compared with that of certain existing methodologies.",

It is one of the greatest health hazards of the twenty-first century which poses a great economic threat on many nations. The premise behind effective disease management in healthcare system is to ensure coordinated intervention targeted towards reducing the incidence of such disease. This paper presents an approach to reducing the incidence of diabetes by predicting the risk of diabetes in patients. Diabetes mellitus risk prediction model was developed using supervised machine learning algorithms of Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine and J48 Decision Tree. The decision tree was able to give a prediction accuracy of 95.09% using rules of prediction that give acceptable results, that is, the model was approximately 95% accurate. The easy-to-understand rules of prediction got from J48 decision tree make it excellent in developing predictive models.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has become one of blooming research topics in recent years. Many applications can be found from integrating various techniques such as Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to the obtrusive platforms that include the domains of healthcare, economics and agriculture. Researchers on healthcare domains have built effective systems to help clinicians alleviate diagnosis efforts. However, some models lacked flexibility to interpret the knowledge as if clinician's indulgement. To overcome such problems, SVM, one of the supervised learning algorithms with kernel radial basis function (RBF) as a nonlinear classification model, was exploited to classify and extract knowledge from medical data. The idea behind the proposed system was to classify the given data step by step by SVM. Incorrectly classified patterns will be fed to the succeeding stage to find a better split point in SVM. Split point was used to calculate information gain that can identify principal features from candidate attributes. Finally, knowledge-based decision trees were constructed from the ordered information gain to classify the unknown medical patterns. Experimental results from three different datasets verified that the proposed system was effective and feasible for the classification of medical databases.",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning has a wide array of applications in the healthcare domain and has been used extensively for analyzing data. Apnea of Prematurity is a breathing disorder commonly observed in preterm infants. This paper compares the usage of Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, which are supervised learning algorithms, to predict Apnea of Prematurity at the end of the first week of the child's birth using data collected during the first three days of neonatal life. This paper also uses an optimization method called Synthesized Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to resolve the class imbalance problem observed in the data. Principal Component Analysis and one-hot encoding have been implemented for feature extraction and data preprocessing respectively. Among the results obtained, an AUC of 0.72 using the amalgamation of Random Forests and SMOTE is found to be the most accurate model.",

        "abstract": "Metric and kernel learning arise in several machine learning applications. However, most existing metric learning algorithms are limited to learning metrics over low-dimensional data, while existing kernel learning algorithms are often limited to the transductive setting and do not generalize to new data points. In this paper, we study the connections between metric learning and kernel learning that arise when studying metric learning as a linear transformation learning problem. In particular, we propose a general optimization framework for learning metrics via linear transformations, and analyze in detail a special case of our framework-that of minimizing the LogDet divergence subject to linear constraints. We then propose a general regularized framework for learning a kernel matrix, and show it to be equivalent to our metric learning framework. Our theoretical connections between metric and kernel learning have two main consequences: 1) the learned kernel matrix parameterizes a linear transformation kernel function and can be applied inductively to new data points, 2) our result yields a constructive method for kernelizing most existing Mahalanobis metric learning formulations. We demonstrate our learning approach by applying it to large-scale real world problems in computer vision, text mining and semi-supervised kernel dimensionality reduction.",

        "abstract": "\n \n \n The combination of medical knowledge, experience and AI algorithms have supported the advancement of patient care and the lowering of healthcare costs. Machine and deep learning methods enable the extraction of meaningful patterns that remain beyond human perception. Numerous computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems have been developed to assist in the assessment of stress echocardiograms. However, issues are encountered when facing imbalanced, limited, and unannotated datasets. Learning from imbalanced medical datasets impairs diagnostic accuracy due to classifier bias and overfitting. Furthermore, datasets comprising of all existing abnormal classes are impossible to obtain, hence supervised algorithms would fail to generate predictions for classes devoid of training samples. Moreover, reliance on prior knowledge in the form of expert annotation and anatomical region extraction impairs scalability, as these procedures are time-consuming, computationally expensive, and limited to specific tasks.\n \n \n \n We aimed to perform one-class classification and anomaly detection of stress echocardiograms using unsupervised deep learning techniques to discriminate between normal and abnormal videos as well as to localise wall motion abnormalities within individual frames.\n \n \n \n Deep denoising spatio-temporal autoencoder networks were employed to learn visual and motion representations from multiple echocardiographic cross-sections and stress stages. Extracted middle layer features were modelled by one-class support vector machines to discriminate between regular and irregular echocardiograms despite the absence of abnormal training samples. Reconstruction errors allowed for direct visualisation and localisation of anomalous cardiac regions, without the need for annotated training data or segmentation of structures.\n \n \n \n 2D B-mode stress echocardiograms acquired from 36 patients were classified as normal or abnormal based on patient reports and served as the ground truth. Results revealed that learnt features extracted from spatio-temporal autoencoders trained solely on normal data can be utilised to classify abnormal echocardiograms with a high level of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. In addition to that, as validated by an expert reader, spatio-temporal autoencoder reconstruction errors were capable of detecting and localising wall motion abnormalities in specific cardiac regions without prior knowledge of abnormal segments.\n \n \n \n The trained model enables the classification and detection of spatio-temporal abnormalities in stress echocardiograms. Therefore, the proposed networks have the potential of assisting in the global and regional assessment of stress echocardiograms.\n",

        "title": "Generalization of Deep Neural Network of Hospital Readmission Prediction Models for Diabetes Patients Using Apache Spark Clustering",
        "abstract": "The high readmission rate, which is the percentage of patients who admitted to the hospital within a specific period after they have been discharged, is a major concern for many healthcare organizations. Reducing it would help significantly improving healthcare services by lowering the pressure on reception, focusing the resources on cases that need special care which could help to save their lives, being cost-efficient, and finally, it would provide a better life quality for the patients. Reducing the readmission rate could be done by studying the relation between the readmission rate and the factors of the patients such as age, race, number of diagnoses, and others. Many studies have studied this relation using different machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning, which includes clustering algorithms such as k-means and supervised learning which includes regression and classification algorithms such as KNN, decision trees, and neural networks. This research uses a dataset of diabetic patients, which was gathered from 130 different US hospitals for years 1999–2008 with more than 100,000 instances and 55 different attributes to study the relationship between the readmission rate and other factors of the patients to determine the most influential factors that lead to a higher readmission rate and determine the most important factors that help to reduce readmission rate. Our novel solution consists of two stages, the first stage is developing predictive models for predicting readmission rates accurately, then use those models to identify the critical risk factors. As we experiment with different machine learning models, we report an accuracy of 53%, 35.7%, 35%, 11.6%, 50% on a held-out test set for KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector, and deep neural networks respectively, and using ablation study we identified the top ten influential risk factors. As for the second stage, we reduced the computational time for training the machine learning models using the Spark cluster-computing framework to distribute the dataset across 4 workers to speed up the training process, and we report a 32% time reduction compared with running the models without Spark.",

        "title": "Predicting Neonatal Encephalopathy From Maternal Data in Electronic Medical Records",
        "abstract": "Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and lifetime neurological disability. The earlier the risk of NE can be assessed, the more effective interventions can be in preventing adverse outcomes. Existing studies that focus on intrapartum risk factors do not provide the early prognostic forecasting necessary to prepare healthcare professionals to intervene early in a high-risk NE case. This work used maternal data in a supervised machine learning framework to predict NE events. Specifically, we 1) collected the electronic medical records (EMRs) for 104 NE newborns and 31,054 non-NE newborns and their mothers, 2) trained and tested a regularized logistic regression on imbalanced and high-dimensional EMR data, and 3) discerned important features that could be possible risk factors. The learned model offers prenatal predictions of NE cases with an average area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 87% and identified the most important predictors.",

        "title": "Gene-Metabolite Interaction in the One Carbon Metabolism Pathway: Predictors of Colorectal Cancer in Multi-Ethnic Families",
        "abstract": "For personalized healthcare, the purpose of this study was to examine the key genes and metabolites in the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway and their interactions as predictors of colorectal cancer (CRC) in multi-ethnic families. In this proof-of-concept study, we included a total of 30 participants, 15 CRC cases and 15 matched family/friends representing major ethnic groups in southern California. Analytics based on supervised machine learning were applied, with the target variable being specified as cancer, including the ensemble method and generalized regression (GR) prediction. Elastic Net with Akaike’s Information Criterion with correction (AICc) and Leave-One-Out cross validation GR methods were used to validate the results for enhanced optimality, prediction, and reproducibility. The results revealed that despite some family members sharing genetic heritage, the CRC group had greater combined gene polymorphism-mutations than the family controls (p < 0.1) for five genes including MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, MTR A2756G, MTRR A66G, and DHFR 19bp. Blood metabolites including homocysteine (7 µmol/L), methyl-folate (40 nmol/L) with total gene mutations (≥4); age (51 years) and vegetable intake (2 cups), and interactions of gene mutations and methylmalonic acid (MMA) (400 nmol/L) were significant predictors (all p < 0.0001) using the AICc. The results were validated by a 3% misclassification rate, AICc of 26, and >99% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. These results point to the important roles of blood metabolites as potential markers in the prevention of CRC. Future intervention studies can be designed to target the ways to mitigate the enzyme-metabolite deficiencies in the OCM pathway to prevent cancer.",

        "abstract": "As mobile and personal health devices gain in popularity, increasing amounts of data is collected via their embedded sensors such as heart rate monitors and accelerometers. Data analytics and more specifically machine learning algorithms can transform this data into actionable information to improve personal healthcare and quality of life. The main objective of this study is to develop an algorithmic classification framework using feed-forward multilayer perceptrons and statistically rich spectrotemporal features to recognize daily activities based on 3-axis acceleration data. A multitude of MLP topologies and setups, such as different numbers and sizes of hidden layers, supervised output structuring, etc. are tested to comprehensively analyze the clustering capabilities of the artificial neural network for a wide-range of settings. In addition, the contribution of subset of features to classification accuracy is studied to identify respective information potentials and further improve accuracy. Publicly available wrist-worn accelerometer dataset from University of California Irvine's machine learning repository is used for fair comparison with the most recent literature published using the same dataset. Results indicate a significant improvement in recognition rate where the overall accuracy over seven selected activity classes is 91% compared to 54% of the latest publication using the same dataset.",

        "title": "A Robust Framework for Accelerated Outcome-driven Risk Factor Identification from EHR",
        "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHR) containing longitudinal information about millions of patient lives are increasingly being utilized by organizations across the healthcare spectrum. Studies on EHR data have enabled real world applications like understanding of disease progression, outcomes analysis, and comparative effectiveness research. However, often every study is independently commissioned, data is gathered by surveys or specifically purchased per study by a long and often painful process. This is followed by an arduous repetitive cycle of analysis, model building, and generation of insights. This process can take anywhere between 1 - 3 years. In this paper, we present a robust end-to-end machine learning based SaaS system to perform analysis on a very large EHR dataset. The framework consists of a proprietary EHR datamart spanning ~55 million patient lives in USA and over ~20 billion data points. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the largest in the industry to analyze medical records at this scale, with such efficacy and ease. We developed an end-to-end ML framework with carefully chosen components to support EHR analysis at scale and suitable for further downstream clinical analysis. Specifically, it consists of a ridge regularized Survival Support Vector Machine (SSVM) with a clinical kernel, coupled with Chi-square distance-based feature selection, to uncover relevant risk factors by exploiting the weak correlations in EHR. Our results on multiple real use cases indicate that the framework identifies relevant factors effectively without expert supervision. The framework is stable, generalizable over outcomes, and also found to contribute to better out-of-bound prediction over known expert features. Importantly, the ML methodologies used are interpretable which is critical for acceptance of our system in the targeted user base. With the system being operational, all of these studies were completed within a time frame of 3-4 weeks compared to the industry standard 12-36 months. As such our system can accelerate analysis and discovery, result in better ROI due to reduced investments as well as quicker turn around of studies.",

        "abstract": "Emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) are a widespread healthcare concern in children and adolescents. Prevention and early intervention are the most powerful tools in ameliorating the problem, and therefore, timely and accurate detection of abnormal emotional patterns is of vital importance. In this paper, we propose a system that detects second-level emotional states of children using hour-level audio recordings. The proposed system consists of an audio segmentation and speaker tracking front-end along with an emotion recognition back-end. Supervised support vector machine is used in the front-end to improve its robustness to short and inconsistent child speech pattern and end-to-end deep learning is used in the emotion recognition back-end to improve its robustness to noise and segmentation error. We further demonstrate the potential of the proposed system as an automated emotion analysis tool.",

        "title": "Analyzing and Predicting the Impact of COVID-19 on Online Pharmaceuticals Sectors and Pathological Services in India",
        "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic that has impacted the healthcare industry. While retail pharmaceutical and medical stores were classified as vital services, online pharmacies emerged as one of the most significant benefactors of India’s pandemic-induced lockdown, as consumers decided to buy medications online to lessen the risk of contamination. The wide-ranging consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak have also prompted healthcare providers to embrace new methods and techniques that allow for at-home lab testing. We conducted a research study and analysis to determine if online pharmacies and at-home lab tests would continue to develop rapidly and become increasingly digital post-COVID pandemic considering that it has been fuelled by the current pandemic crisis and changing customer needs and requirements. The research was carried out considering the factors such as \"Gender, Age-group, how often they use online pharmacies, rating their online pharmacy experiences, how often they purchased medicines online before and during COVID, have they used at-home lab testing services, and rating the quality, discounts, safety, genuineness and time taken for at-home lab testing\". Based on these factors, in this paper, we have built two prediction models that use supervised learning which would predict how likely a person will utilize online pharmacies and at-home lab tests post COVID 19 pandemic. It consists of 5 probabilities i.e. very likely to use it, likely use it, moderately use it, less likely to use it, and rarely use it. The various classification algorithms employed in the study were logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines, and Gradient booster classification algorithm The model’s results are based on the previous data that was collected by asking around 250 individuals. Accuracies obtained for predicting how likely a person will use online pharmacies post COVID are as follows, by gradient booster model the accuracy is ~85%, the accuracy obtained by decision tree classifier is ~71%, by logistic regression model the accuracy is ~85% and accuracy obtained by random forest model is ~78%. Accuracies obtained for predicting how likely a person will use at-home lab tests post COVID are as follows, by decision tree classifier accuracy is ~78%, the accuracy obtained by logistic regression is ~50% and the accuracy obtained by support vector machines is ~64%.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Multilevel fusions and complex osteotomies to restore global alignment in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery can lead to increased operative time and blood loss. In this regard, we assessed factors predictive of perioperative blood product transfusion in patients undergoing long posterior spinal fusion for ASD. Methods A single-institution retrospective review was conducted on 909 patients with ASD, age > 18 years, who underwent surgery for ASD with greater than 4 levels fused. Using conditional inference tree analysis, a machine learning methodology, we sought to predict the combination of variables that best predicted increased risk for intraoperative percent blood volume lost and perioperative blood product transfusion. Results Among the 909 patients included in the study, 377 (41.5%) received red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. The conditional inference tree analysis identified greater than 13 levels fused, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score > 1, a history of hypertension, 3-column osteotomy, pelvic fixation, and operative time > 8 hours, as significant risk factors for perioperative RBC transfusion. The best predictors for the subgroup with the highest risk for intraoperative percent blood volume lost (subgroup mean: 53.1% ± 42.9%) were greater than 13 levels fused, ASA score > 1, preoperative hemoglobin < 13.6 g/dL, 3-column osteotomy, posterior column osteotomy, and pelvic fixation. Patients who underwent major blood transfusion intraoperatively had significantly longer length of stay (8.5 days) versus those who did not (6.1 days) (P < .0001). The overall 90-day complication rate in patients who underwent major blood transfusion intraoperatively was 49%, compared with 19% in those who did not (P < .0001). By multivariate regression analysis, patients with a preoperative hemoglobin > 13.0 were less likely to require major blood transfusion (odds ratio: 0.52, P = .046). Conclusions Using a supervised learning technique, this study demonstrates that greater than 13 levels fused, ASA score > 1, 3-column osteotomy, and pelvic fixation are consistent risk factors for increased intraoperative percent blood volume lost and perioperative RBC transfusion. The addition of having a preoperative hemoglobin < 13.6 g/dL or undergoing a posterior column osteotomy conferred the highest risk for intraoperative blood loss. This information can assist spinal deformity surgeons in identifying at-risk individuals and allocating healthcare resources. Level of Evidence 3.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, photoplethysmogram (PPG) features are combined with supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate arterial blood pressure (ABP). Three algorithms for the estimation of cuffless ABP using PPG signals are compared. Since PPG signals are measured non-invasively, this method guarantees an individuals comfort while not omitting important ABP information. The proposed framework predicts the ABP values by processing PPG signals with semi-classical signal analysis (SCSA) method, extracting several categories of features, which reflect the PPG signal morphology variations. Then, regression algorithms are selected for the ABP estimation. The proposed method is evaluated based on a virtual dataset with more than four thousand subjects and MIMIC II database with over eight thousand subjects for model training and testing. Mean average error (MAE) and standard deviation (STD) are evaluated for different machine learning algorithms during the prediction and estimation process. Multiple linear regression (MLR) meets the AAMI standard in terms of estimation accuracy, which proves that the ABP can be accurately estimated in a nonintrusive fashion. Given the easy implementation of the ABP estimation method, we regard that the proposed features and machine learning algorithms for the cuffless estimation of the ABP can potentially provide the means for mobile healthcare equipment to monitor the ABP continuously.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a system with multimodality that monitors objective biomarkers for screening the mental distress in the office. A field study using a prototype of the system was performed over four months with 39 volunteers. We obtained PC operation patterns using a PC logger, sleeping time and activity levels using a wrist-band-type activity tracker, and brain activity and behavior data during a working memory task using optical topography. We also administered two standard questionnaires: the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJS) and the Kessler 6 scale (K6). Supervised machine learning and cross validation were performed. The objective variables were mental scores obtained from the questionnaires and the explanatory variables were the biomarkers obtained from the modalities. Multiple linear regression models for mental scores were comprehensively searched and the optimum models were selected from 2,619,785 candidates. Each mental score estimated with each optimum model was well correlated with each mental score obtained with the questionnaire (correlation coefficient = 0.6–0.8) within a 24% of estimation error. Mental scores obtained by means of questionnaires have been in general use in mental health care for a while, so our multimodality system is potentially useful for mental healthcare due to the quantitative agreement on the mental scores estimated with biomarkers and the mental scores obtained with questionnaires.",

        "title": "WearMask: Fast In-browser Face Mask Detection with Serverless Edge Computing for COVID-19",
        "abstract": "The COVID-19 epidemic has been a significant healthcare challenge in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 infection is transmitted predominately by respiratory droplets generated when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze. Wearing a mask is the primary, effective, and convenient method of blocking 80% of all respiratory infections. Therefore, many face mask detection and monitoring systems have been developed to provide effective supervision for hospitals, airports, publication transportation, sports venues, and retail locations. However, the current commercial face mask detection systems are typically bundled with specific software or hardware, impeding public accessibility. In this paper, we propose an in-browser serverless edge-computing based face mask detection solution, called Web-based efficient AI recognition of masks (WearMask), which can be deployed on any common devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, computers) that have internet connections using web browsers, without installing any software. The serverless edge-computing design minimizes the extra hardware costs (e.g., specific devices or cloud computing servers). The contribution of the proposed method is to provide a holistic edge-computing framework of integrating (1) deep learning models (YOLO), (2) high-performance neural network inference computing framework (NCNN), and (3) a stack-based virtual machine (WebAssembly). For end-users, our web-based solution has advantages of (1) serverless edge-computing design with minimal device limitation and privacy risk, (2) installation free deployment, (3) low computing requirements, and (4) high detection speed. Our WearMask application has been launched with public access at facemask-detection.com.",

        "title": "EMIXER: End-to-end Multimodal X-ray Generation via Self-supervision",
        "abstract": "Deep generative models have enabled the automated synthesis of high-quality data for diverse applications. However, the most effective generative models are specialized to data from a single domain (e.g., images or text). Real-world applications such as healthcare require multi-modal data from multiple domains (e.g., both images and corresponding text), which are difficult to acquire due to limited availability and privacy concerns and are much harder to synthesize. To tackle this joint synthesis challenge, we propose an End-to-end MultImodal X-ray genERative model (EMIXER) for jointly synthesizing x-ray images and corresponding free-text reports, all conditional on diagnosis labels. EMIXER is an conditional generative adversarial model by 1) generating an image based on a label, 2) encoding the image to a hidden embedding, 3) producing the corresponding text via a hierarchical decoder from the image embedding, and 4) a joint discriminator for assessing both the image and the corresponding text. EMIXER also enables self-supervision to leverage vast amount of unlabeled data. Extensive experiments with real X-ray reports data illustrate how data augmentation using synthesized multimodal samples can improve the performance of a variety of supervised tasks including COVID-19 X-ray classification with very limited samples. The quality of generated images and reports are also confirmed by radiologists. We quantitatively show that EMIXER generated synthetic datasets can augment X-ray image classification, report generation models to achieve 5.94% and 6.9% improvement on models trained only on real data samples. Taken together, our results highlight the promise of state of generative models to advance clinical machine learning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Technology has aided the improvement of individual health, healthcare, biomedical research as well as public health. Therefore, healthcare institutions are seeking to develop integrated information-management environments to consolidate the inevitable application of big data to health care. There exist various entry points into the medical world where computational tools assist patient care matters; reporting results of tests, allowing direct entry of orders or patient information by clinicians, facilitating access to transcribed reports, and in some cases supporting telemedicine applications, because of disorganized and incomplete patient records pose an obstacle to patient care. The most common medium by which records of medical history are kept is paper making data management a severe impediment to productivity. However, the promise of a more efficient healthcare service is obvious through the use of automated health records management systems. Heart disease is a common disease that is overlooked by most. In this study, we discuss how a person can figure out if they need to go to a doctor for a health check-up for any heart-related issues using machine learning algorithms.

        "abstract": "As advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) continue at an ever-increasing rate, there are growing concerns over the potential development of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS), commonly known as ‘killer robots’.1 Such systems are defined as any weapon capable of targeting and initiating the use of potentially lethal force without direct human supervision and direct human involvement in lethal decision making.2 Several countries, including the UK, are developing these weapons for military use, setting the stage for an imminent arms race. The emergence of these technologies would represent the complete automation of lethal harm, which AI experts fear would mark a third revolution in warfare, following gunpowder and nuclear weapons.3 LAWS would radically violate the ethical principles and moral code that are integral to our profession, necessitating urgent and collective action from the entire healthcare community.\n\nThe prospect of a world with LAWS generates ethical, legal, and diplomatic apprehensions. These technologies would bring dire humanitarian consequences and geopolitical destabilisation. They would make possible the …",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Urban and population growth results in increasing pressure on the public utilities like transport, energy, healthcare services, crime management and emergency services in the realm of smart city management. Smart management of these services increases the necessity of dealing with big data which is come from different sources with various types and formats like 3D city information, GPS, traffic, mobile, Building Information Model (BIM), environmental, social activities and IoT stream data. Therefore, an approach to mine/analysis/interpret these data and extract useful knowledge from this diverse big data sources emerges in order to extract the hidden pattern of data using computational algorithms from statistics, machine learning and information theory. However, inconsistency, duplication and repetition and misconducting with the different type of discrete and continuous data can cause erroneous decision-making. This paper focuses on providing a rules extraction and supervised-decision making methods for facilitating the fusion of BIM and 2D and 3D GIS-based information coupling with IoT stream data residing in a spatial database and 3D BIM data. The proposed methods can be used in those applications like Emergency Response, Evacuation Planning, Occupancy Mapping, and Urban Monitoring to Smart Multi-Buildings so that their input data mostly come from 2D and 3D GIS, BIM and IoT stream. This research focus on proposing the unified rules extraction and decision engine to help smart citizens and managers using BIM and GIS data to make smart decision rather than focus on applications in certain field of BIM and GIS.\n",

        "abstract": "Keywords and keyphrases are important for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as document classification, information retrieval, and topic identification. They are also useful for capturing different classes of entities from content related to healthcare, biology, food science, and journalism fields. There are different approaches to extract keywords and keyphrases. Deep learning approaches have achieved high-performance results in terms of keywords and keyphrase extraction. However, among deep learning approaches, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) potentials have not been fully explored as a technique for extracting keywords and keyphrases. In this work, we performed a comparative study using a benchmark dataset, the IEEE Xplore collection to test the CNN generalization ability in selecting keywords and keyphrases. In addition, we further collected a corpus in the field of foodborne illness outbreaks. We utilize this corpus to develop a CNN-based identification approach of keywords and keyphrases related to foodborne illnesses. Results were compared with several supervised (KEA, GuidedLDA) and unsupervised (LDA) machine learning algorithms. CNN outperformed these algorithms in selecting relevant keywords and keyphrases for foodborne illnesses. The findings of this study have also confirmed superiority of CNN-based algorithm for keyphrase extraction to other machine learning approaches.",

        "abstract": "Medical information extraction is the automatic extraction of structured information from electronic medical records, where such information can be used for improving healthcare processes and medical decision making. In this paper, we study one important medical information extraction task called section classification. The objective of section classification is to automatically identify sections in a medical document and classify them into one of the pre-defined section types. Training section classification models typically requires large amounts of human labeled training data to achieve high accuracy. Annotating institution-specific data, however, can be both expensive and time-consuming; which poses a big hurdle for adapting a section classification model to new medical institutions. In this paper, we apply two advanced machine learning techniques, active learning and distant supervision, to reduce annotation cost and achieve fast model adaptation for automated section classification in electronic medical records. Our experiment results show that active learning reduces the annotation cost and time by more than 50%, and distant supervision can achieve good model accuracy using weakly labeled training data only.",

This research seeks to analyze facial palsy domain using facial features and grade the degree of nerve damage according to House-Brackmann score. Traditional evaluation methods involve a medical doctor taking a thorough history of a patient and determines the onset of the paralysis, the rate of progression and etc. The most important step is to assess the degree of voluntary movement present and document the grade of facial paralysis using House-Brackmann score. The significance of this work is that we attempt to apprehend this grading using semi-supervised learning with the aim of automating this grading process. The value of this research stems from the fact that there is a lack of literature seen in this area. The use of automated grading system greatly reduces assessment time and increases consistency because references of all palsy images are stored to provide references and comparison. The proposed automated diagnostics methods are computationally efficient making them ideal for remote assessment of facial palsy, profiling of a large number of facial images captured using mobile phones and digital cameras.",

        "title": "Standardization in surgery: friend or foe?",
        "abstract": "The definition of an acceptable standard of healthcare has become more focused by the concepts of personalized medicine with targeted and tailored therapy. Variation in surgical care1–4 and decision-making5 is common. The chances of undergoing surgery may depend as much on where a person lives as on clinical circumstances1,6,7. Some patient choices drive variation (for example by seeking ‘exceptional care’, or the belief thereof) as happens with robotic surgery8, despite lack of documented benefits and even risk of harm9. These circumstances will arise more as patient preferences are expressed and heard (appropriately) in shared decision-making. Meanwhile opponents to standardization consider it diametrically opposed to individualized or patient-centred care10 and a one-size-fits-all, narrow-minded exclusionary attitude. Variation in surgical procedures is not a bad thing but patient outcomes may be unacceptably heterogeneous, especially when delivered beyond the intended use. Unwanted procedures or techniques with inferior outcomes11 drive up healthcare costs12, but cessation may be challenging. As reported in ‘choosing wisely’ campaigns, standardization rarely involves stopping surgical procedures that may be display low value for healthcare systems. The recent moratorium on transanal total mesorectal excision in Norway demonstrates the need to step back and re-evaluate a procedure based on detrimental outcomes13,14. Refinement of patient selection, standardized training, and supervision with evaluation of appropriate outcomes to expected standards are key. This highlights the need for standardization, audit and mature reflection when introducing a new intervention15. Clearly the multicontextual nature of healthcare does not facilitate standardization in every circumstance because patients display biological, psychological, social and cultural diversity. In addition, healthcare professionals have considerably diverse views and perspectives – perhaps defined by the apprenticeship model of training where vertically transmitted approaches to care are ingrained – such that geographical heterogeneity is common. A good example is the approach to managing lateral pelvic sidewall lymph nodes in patients with rectal cancer, where there has been an historical East–West divide. These experiences and tacit knowledge bases constitute ‘mindlines’ as a result of decision maps created by learned behaviour rather than being evidence-based in favour of one or other option. Variation in treatment options is an integral component of individualized care, where several options – each with its inherent benefits and risks – may lead to a good outcome. The risk–benefit is balanced by the surgeon’s aim for the procedure (such as restoration of function or curative intent), the patient’s expectations, and their collective willingness to compromise between risk, benefit and functional consequences. Decisions are sometimes based more on cultural context (for example, routine diverting stoma with an anterior resection) and risk experience (more likely to divert following a recent anastomotic leak) over the reality of clinical knowledge. Ultimately, the decision is best made by an informed patient with clinician involvement with visual aids or internet-based exploration (if needed) at the point of care. Validated comparisons of the different available treatment options, where feasible, should be the goal of standardized care. It is not surprising that agreeing on what standardization means specifically is challenging. The WHO has defined it as ‘the process of developing, agreeing upon and implementing uniform technical specifications, criteria, methods, processes, designs or practices that can increase compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability and quality’16. Standardization can be implemented at several levels in healthcare (Table 1), with some examples published recently17,18. Some types of standard may be widespread, whereas others (typically relating to devices) vary considerably and seem to depend on individual surgeon preference19. In theory, most care plans could be standardized within a given institution as standard operating protocols (or procedures), but with some flexibility to encapsulate aberrant disease presentation or variable patient/clinician choices. It is probable that new technologies, smartphones and apps will improve protocol-driven healthcare delivery including perioperative care20. Big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning",

        "title": "Application of AI and ML in the Field of DevSecOps",
        "abstract": "Security is a paramount concern in DevOps. The adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has increased the potential impact of even minor flaws, particularly in critical domains like healthcare and maritime applications. Existing solutions typically focus on either Static Application Security Testing (SAST) or run-time behavior analysis. This paper introduces the IaC Scan Runner, an open-source tool developed in Python for inspecting various IaC languages during application design, and LOMOS, a run-time anomaly detection tool. Both tools work together to enhance the security of DevOps processes. In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, the vulnerability of infrastructure and applications is growing due to a combination of factors. Attackers are becoming more sophisticated, leveraging improved intelligence to exploit weaknesses. At the same time, there is a lack of technical capability in many organizations to effectively secure their systems. This paper explores a dual approach to cybersecurity: static security monitoring through rule matching and the application of self-supervised machine learning. By combining these approaches, organizations can better defend against cyber threats. One area of focus is supply chain resilience and smart logistics, where the integration of these methods is particularly critical. This approach emphasizes a self-learning and self-healing approach, allowing systems to adapt and respond to new threats autonomously. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) into DevSecOps practices is essential for improving security, efficiency, and innovation in software development and deployment. This paper delves into strategies and best practices for leveraging AI/ML within the DevSecOps framework. It discusses automated threat detection, predictive analytics for vulnerability management, and intelligent automation for continuous integration and deployment. However, this integration also presents challenges, such as data privacy, algorithm transparency, and ethical implications. The paper addresses these challenges and showcases how organizations can use AI/ML to optimize their DevSecOps pipelines, mitigate security risks, and foster continuous improvement. The adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has increased the potential impact of even minor flaws, especially in critical domains like healthcare and maritime applications. Existing solutions typically focus on either Static Application Security Testing (SAST) or run-time behavior analysis.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing in recent years with the improvements in several different applications in the military, marine, intelligent transportation, smart health, smart grid, smart home and smart city domains. Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms. RF algorithm has showed better performance with 91.56% accuracy than SVM with 88.71% and ANN with 90.02% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Several aspects, such as drug interactions and adverse effects, must be taken into account before prescribing a drug. The fact that some pharmacological qualities, such as side effects, are dependent on patient variables such as age and gender, complicates the procedure even further. Our goal is to create a platform that will aid doctors in prescription medications. This paper devises a method for searching for medications that meet a set of criteria based on drug attributes. Both healthcare professionals who prescribe and dispense pharmaceuticals, as well as drug users, should take several precautions when using pharmaceutical drugs. Prescription drug interactions, interactions with the patient’s existing medicine, potential adverse effects, and contraindications must all be considered. Furthermore, patient characteristics such as age, gender, habits, and genetic profiles influence pharmacological attributes such as side effects and efficacy. The objective is to develop a system that will assist medical professionals and drug users in choosing and locating appropriate drugs. Users can select side effects and the approach answers to their needs. Data about drugs comes from a variety of places. Medicine data, on the other hand, is typically noisy and incomplete because it is either manually developed or mechanically retrieved from text resources like drug labels. Data science technology known as a supervised Machine learning algorithm can be used to analyze medications based on various aspects with better accuracy to deal with incomplete and noisy data.",

These days Computer technology holds an essential importance in the fields of medical science including diagnosis, performance of illness, suitable supervising of patients etc. The objective of my paper is to provide a fuzzy skilled system for forecast of cardiovascular syndrome. We had used seven input attributes for our proposed system. The Data sets are taken from UCI (Machine learning repository). Seven important attributes are used and one output is processed. We get our result from the system design which is obtained from the fuzzy based algorithm. The seven inputs attributes are: Age, Blood pressure, Cholesterol, Heart Rate, Blood sugar, E.C.G, Thallium scan. In our projected paper all the inputs range, its membership function and its graphs are properly shown. In the later section we had successfully tested and compared our result using testing data sets performance with other algorithm which is neural networks. A proposed new and innovative Graphic user interface (GUI) for our proposed system which can compare our results with both these algorithms and display the results is also given.",

        "title": "SALTClass: classifying clinical short notes using background knowledge from unlabeled data",
        "abstract": "Background With the increasing use of unstructured text in electronic health records, extracting useful related information has become a necessity. Text classification can be applied to extract patients’ medical history from clinical notes. However, the sparsity in clinical short notes, that is, excessively small word counts in the text, can lead to large classification errors. Previous studies demonstrated that natural language processing (NLP) can be useful in the text classification of clinical outcomes. We propose incorporating the knowledge from unlabeled data, as this may alleviate the problem of short noisy sparse text. Results The software package SALTClass (short and long text classifier) is a machine learning NLP toolkit. It uses seven clustering algorithms, namely, latent Dirichlet allocation, K-Means, MiniBatchK-Means, BIRCH, MeanShift, DBScan, and GMM. Smoothing methods are applied to the resulting cluster information to enrich the representation of sparse text. For the subsequent prediction step, SALTClass can be used on either the original document-term matrix or in an enrichment pipeline. To this end, ten different supervised classifiers have also been integrated into SALTClass. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the SALTClass NLP toolkit in the identification of patients’ family history in a Dutch clinical cardiovascular text corpus from University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. Conclusions The considerable amount of unstructured short text in healthcare applications, particularly in clinical cardiovascular notes, has created an urgent need for tools that can parse specific information from text reports. Using machine learning algorithms for enriching short text can improve the representation for further applications. Availability SALTClass can be downloaded as a Python package from Python Package Index (PyPI) website at https://pypi.org/project/saltclass and from GitHub at https://github.com/bagheria/saltclass.",

        "abstract": "Chronic diseases benefit of the advances on personalize medicine coming out of the integrative convergence of significant developments in systems biology, the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. 70% to 80% of all healthcare costs in the EU and US are currently spent on chronic diseases, leading to estimated costs of ${\\rm C}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!=$700 billion and ${\\$}$3.5 trillion respectively. The management of symptomatic pain crises in chronic diseases is based on general clinical guidelines that do not take into account the singularities of the crises, such as their intensity or duration, so that the pain of those particular crises may cause the medication to be ineffective and lead the patient to overmedication. Knowing in detail the characteristics of the pain would help the physician to objectively prescribe personalized treatments for each patient and crisis. In this manuscript, we make a step further on the prediction of symptomatic crisis from ambulatory collected data in chronic diseases. We propose a categorization of pain types according to subjective symptoms of real patients. Our approach has been evaluated in the migraine disease. The migraine is one of the most disabling neurological diseases that affects over 12% of the population worldwide and leads to high economic costs for private and public health systems. This study aims to classify pain episodes by the characterization of pain curves reported by patients in real time. Pain curves have been described as a set of morphological features. With these features the pain episodes are clustered then classified by unsupervised and supervised machine learning models. It is shown that the evolution of different pain episodes in chronic diseases can be modeled and clustered. Over a population of 51 migraine patients, it has been found that there are 4 clusters of pain types that can be classified using 4 morphological features with an accuracy of 99.0% using a Logistic Model Tree algorithm.",

        "title": "A Winnow-Based Approach to Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction",
        "abstract": "A large class of machine-learning problems in natural language require the characterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such problems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their target concepts depend on only a small subset of the features in the space. Under such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow have been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. In the work reported here, we present an algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and apply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling correction. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in valid words, such as substituting to for too, casual for causal, and so on. We evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a statistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We find: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves accuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the pruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the literature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) While several aspects of WinSpell's architecture contribute to its superiority over BaySpell, the primary factor is that it is able to learn a better linear separator than BaySpell learns; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the training set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt, using a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the training set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.",

        "title": "Mining clinical relationships from patient narratives",
        "abstract": "BackgroundThe Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF) project has built a system to extract clinically significant information from the textual component of medical records in order to support clinical research, evidence-based healthcare and genotype-meets-phenotype informatics. One part of this system is the identification of relationships between clinically important entities in the text. Typical approaches to relationship extraction in this domain have used full parses, domain-specific grammars, and large knowledge bases encoding domain knowledge. In other areas of biomedical NLP, statistical machine learning (ML) approaches are now routinely applied to relationship extraction. We report on the novel application of these statistical techniques to the extraction of clinical relationships.ResultsWe have designed and implemented an ML-based system for relation extraction, using support vector machines, and trained and tested it on a corpus of oncology narratives hand-annotated with clinically important relationships. Over a class of seven relation types, the system achieves an average F1 score of 72%, only slightly behind an indicative measure of human inter annotator agreement on the same task. We investigate the effectiveness of different features for this task, how extraction performance varies between inter- and intra-sentential relationships, and examine the amount of training data needed to learn various relationships.ConclusionWe have shown that it is possible to extract important clinical relationships from text, using supervised statistical ML techniques, at levels of accuracy approaching those of human annotators. Given the importance of relation extraction as an enabling technology for text mining and given also the ready adaptability of systems based on our supervised learning approach to other clinical relationship extraction tasks, this result has significance for clinical text mining more generally, though further work to confirm our encouraging results should be carried out on a larger sample of narratives and relationship types.",

        "title": "Quantifying Self-Reported Adverse Drug Events on Twitter: Signal and Topic Analysis",
        "abstract": "When a drug that is sold exhibits side effects, a well functioning ecosystem of pharmaceutical drug suppliers includes responsive regulators and pharmaceutical companies. Existing systems for monitoring adverse drug events, such as the Federal Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) in the US, have shown limited effectiveness due to the lack of incentives for healthcare professionals and patients. While social media present opportunities to mine information about adverse events in near real-time, there are still important questions to be answered in order to understand their impact on pharmacovigilance. First, it is not known how many relevant social media posts occur per day on platforms like Twitter, i.e., whether there is \"enough signal\" for a post-market pharmacovigilance program based on Twitter mining. Second, it is not known what other topics are discussed by users in posts mentioning pharmaceutical drugs. In this paper, we outline how social media can be used as a human sensor for drug use monitoring. We introduce a large-scale, near real-time system for computational pharmacovigilance, and use our system to estimate the order of magnitude of the volume of daily self-reported pharmaceutical drug side effect tweets. The processing pipeline comprises a set of cascaded filters, followed by a supervised machine learning classifier. The cascaded filters quickly reduce the volume to a manageable sub-stream, from which a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier identifies adverse events based on a rich set of features taking into account surface-textual properties, as well as domain knowledge about drugs, side effects and the Twitter medium. Using a dataset of 10,000 manually annotated tweets, a SVM classifier achieves F1=60.4% and AUC=0.894. The yield of the classifier for a drug universe comprising 2,600 keywords is 721 tweets per day. We also investigate what other topics are discussed in the posts mentioning pharmaceutical drugs. We conclude by suggesting an ecosystem where regulators and pharmaceutical companies utilize social media to obtain feedback about consequences of pharmaceutical drug use.",

The method starts with unsupervised analysis of past payments to determine normal levels of payments for services. Then, supervised machine learning is used to derive sets of attributional rules for predicting potential discrepancies in claims. New claims can be then classified using the created models. The method was tested on a subset of Obstetrics claims for payment submitted by one hospital to Medicaid.

        "abstract": "The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent transmission among communities has made the entire human population extremely vulnerable. Due to the virus’s contagiousness, the most powerful economies in the world are struggling with the inadequacies of resources. As the number of cases continues to rise and the healthcare industry is overwhelmed with the increasing needs of the infected population, there is a requirement to estimate the potential future number of cases using prediction methods. This paper leverages data-driven estimation methods such as linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) algorithm. All three algorithms are trained using the COVID-19 data of Pakistan from 24 February to 31 December 2020, wherein the daily resolution is integrated. Essentially, this paper postulates that, with the help of values of new positive cases, medical swabs, daily death, and daily new positive cases, it is possible to predict the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate future trends. Linear regression tends to oversimplify concepts in supervised learning and neglect practical challenges present in the real world, often cited as its primary disadvantage. In this paper, we use an enhanced random forest algorithm. It is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification. This algorithm works well for an extensive range of data items, and also it is very flexible and possesses very high accuracy. For higher accuracy, we have also implemented the XGBoost algorithm on the dataset. XGBoost is a newly introduced machine learning algorithm; this algorithm provides high accuracy of prediction models, and it is observed that it performs well in short-term prediction. This paper discusses various factors such as total COVID-19 cases, new cases per day, total COVID-19 related deaths, new deaths due to the COVID-19, the total number of recoveries, number of daily recoveries, and swabs through the proposed technique. This paper presents an innovative approach that assists health officials in Pakistan with their decision-making processes.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes and evaluates the performance of a Cyber-healthcare system which is aimed at providing patient prioritization over the cloud as a public health service for the rural and urban communities of the developing world. The underlying cloud-based Internet-of-Things (IoT-Cloud) infrastructure is aimed to be implemented in the city of Lubumbashi in the republic Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with the objective of setting up a community health care network around a mesh of health kiosks. We propose a deployment model for the proposed Cyber-healthcare system, and describe a patient prioritization process as part of its situation awareness component. The results obtained from an experimental prototype reveal the field readiness of the off-the-shelf bio-sensor technology used by the system, the performance achieved when using a solar powered subsystem, the relative communication capabilities provided by its protocols and the network engineering feasibility of the planned community health care network. The relative efficiency of using supervised machine learning compared to unsupervised machine learning when performing patient prioritization, is also revealed through two popular algorithms: Multivariate linear regression (MLR) and K-means clustering (KMC).",

        "abstract": "Automated prediction of valence, one key feature of a person's emotional state, from individuals' personal narratives may provide crucial information for mental healthcare (e.g. early diagnosis of mental diseases, supervision of disease course, etc.). In the Interspeech 2018 ComParE Self-Assessed Affect challenge, the task of valence prediction was framed as a three-class classification problem using 8 seconds fragments from individuals' narratives. As such, the task did not allow for exploring contextual information of the narratives. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic information from multiple narratives recounted by the same individual in order to predict their current state-of-mind. Furthermore, with generalizability in mind, we decided to focus our experiments exclusively on textual information as the public availability of audio narratives is limited compared to text. Our hypothesis is, that context modeling might provide insights about emotion triggering concepts (e.g. events, people, places) mentioned in the narratives that are linked to an individual's state of mind. We explore multiple machine learning techniques to model narratives. We find that the models are able to capture inter-individual differences, leading to more accurate predictions of an individual's emotional state, as compared to single narratives.",

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Pediatric Critical Care Medicine: Are We (Finally) Ready?",
        "abstract": "Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited Pediatric Critical Care Medicine www.pccmjournal.org 997 In this issue of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, a timely work by Alexander et al (1) and a multidisciplinary team aimed to develop a methodology to predict extended cardiac ICU length of stay following surgery for congenital heart disease in order to optimize hospital resource utilization. The study by Alexander et al (1) employed a multivariable logistic regression methodology of predictive factors in a retrospective analysis with a model that was built to predict the outcome postoperative ICU length of stay greater than 7 days; an additional model was built with inclusion of intraoperative factors. Although this academic effort is laudable for its efforts to espouse the significance of assessing value of critical care delivery, the “top-down” selection of variables as well as methodology used (logistic regression) that is most likely in the realm of advanced biostatistics or simple supervised machine learning is perhaps becoming out-of-date. It is time for all of us in clinical medicine to consider an entirely different paradigm of data analysis leading to information and knowledge: deployment of newer methodologies of machine and deep learning or artificial intelligence (AI) and a “bottom-up” approach in step with the expression “with enough data, let the data speak for themselves” (2). This shift in AI adoption to better reflect its advances is demonstrated in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database and its myriad of publications summarized in a recent article (3). One new methodology is deep reinforcement learning, which was successful in the form of the program “AlphaGo” in defeating the human Go champion in a series of matches 2 years ago (4). In this reinforcement type of deep learning, there is a goal-oriented algorithm especially designed for game situations like Go as well as real-life, real-time complex decisions like those in the ICU setting. In addition, deep learning methodology coupled with raw electronic medical records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources format is capable of outperforming the traditional predictive models that have preselected variables like the present article (1) as the new methodology will have the ability of learning many more key factors from the data itself (5). We need innovative solutions to this healthcare data conundrum. First, we need an AI-focused solution to the volume of data by applying this technology at the point of data acquisition and collection (the so-called “internet of everything”). Second, a disruptive technology such as blockchain can perhaps provide the public and clinicians healthcare data access while concomitantly assure patients of data security. Third, we need large common repositories (data reservoirs) that share storage and agility characteristics, so that every stakeholder can work on the data. Fourth, we need much better data infrastructures that is organized, complete, and therefore AI friendly. Last, a graph database format with its elements that are more flexible for healthcare data would be a good forward-thinking solution to the present-day relational database format. All of these aforementioned changes can lead to a biomedical data nirvana: a federated or virtual software-defined meta-database architecture for all of medicine in a dynamic hybrid cloud with real-time analytic processing to provide an AI-in-medicine-as-a-service (“AIMedaas”) for any patient at anytime and anywhere. It is close to 40 years since the ubiquitous personal computer era began with all its astonishing dividends; in AI, we have the wondrous opportunity of another such technological advance that can be of benefit for everyone. AI in the form of convolutional neural network and deep learning is now increasingly adopted in the medical image-focused subspecialties such as radiology, cardiology, pathology, dermatology, and ophthalmology. Similarly, the data-rich clinical milieu of the ICU setting is ideal for a new AI-centric approach to data, information, and knowledge (6) with new AI tools and data strategies. This is therefore another clarion call for ICU physicians and caretakers to embrace this new AI in medicine paradigm: machine intelligence + clinician intelligence = medical intelligence (7).",

        "abstract": "Detecting the presence and amount of private information being shared in online media is the first step towards analyzing information revealing habits of users in social networks and a useful method for researchers to study aggregate privacy behavior. In this work, we aim to find out if text contains private content by using our novel learning based approach `privacy detective' that combines topic modeling, named entity recognition, privacy ontology, sentiment analysis, and text normalization to represent privacy features. Privacy detective investigates a broader range of privacy concerns compared to previous approaches that focus on keyword searching or profile related properties. We collected 500,000 tweets from 100,000 Twitter users along with other information such as tweet linkages and follower relationships. We reach 95.45% accuracy in a two-class task classifying Twitter users who do not reveal much private information and Twitter users who share sensitive information. We score timelines according to three privacy levels after having Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers annotate collected tweets according to privacy categories. Supervised machine learning classification results on these annotations reach 69.63% accuracy on a three-class task. Inter-annotator agreement on timeline privacy scores between various AMT workers and our classifiers fall under the same positive agreement level. Additionally, we show that a user's privacy level is correlated with her friends' privacy scores and also with the privacy scores of people mentioned in her text but not with the number of her followers. As such, privacy in social networks appear to be socially constructed, which can have great implications for privacy enhancing technologies and educational interventions.",
