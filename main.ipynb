Insights about the decision making are mostly opaque for humans. Particularly understanding the decision making in highly sensitive areas such as healthcare or finance, is of paramount importance. The decision-making behind the black boxes requires it to be more transparent, accountable, and understandable for humans.

In resource-constrained hospital environments, a scalable and unified machine learning framework that improves previous forecast performances could improve hospital operations and save costs. We introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning from tabular, time-series, language, and vision data for supervised binary/multiclass classification, regression, and unsupervised clustering. It features a novel attention mechanism balancing self-exploitation (learning source-task), and cross-exploration (learning cross-tasks), and offers explainability through a proposed TIM score, shedding light on the dynamics of task learning interdependencies. M3H encompasses an unprecedented range of medical tasks and machine learning problem classes and consistently outperforms traditional single-task models by on average 11.6% across 40 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments, three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task. The modular design of the framework ensures its generalizability in data processing, task definition, and rapid model prototyping, making it production ready for both clinical and operational healthcare settings, especially those in constrained environments.\n",

Detecting these symptoms is crucial in the initial stage to effectively manage and treat cases of varying severity. Machine learning has made major advances in recent years, proving its effectiveness in various healthcare applications. This study aims to identify patterns of symptoms and general rules regarding symptoms among patients using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The integration of a rule-based machine learning technique and classification methods is utilized to extend a prediction model. This study analyzes patient data that was available online through the Kaggle repository. After preprocessing the data and exploring descriptive statistics, the Apriori algorithm was applied to identify frequent symptoms and patterns in the discovered rules. Additionally, the study applied several machine learning models for predicting diseases, including stepwise regression, support vector machine, bootstrap forest, boosted trees, and neural-boosted methods. Several predictive machine learning models were applied to the dataset to predict diseases. It was discovered that the stepwise method for fitting outperformed all competitors in this study, as determined through cross-validation conducted for each model based on established criteria. Moreover, numerous significant decision rules were extracted in the study, which can streamline clinical applications without the need for additional expertise. These rules enable the prediction of relationships between symptoms and diseases, as well as between different diseases. Therefore, the results obtained in this study have the potential to improve the performance of prediction models. We can discover diseases symptoms and general rules using supervised and unsupervised machine learning for the dataset. Overall, the proposed algorithm can support not only healthcare professionals but also patients who face cost and time constraints in diagnosing and treating these diseases.\n",

This means that there are now more ways than ever to improve patient results and business efficiency. This summary looks at important changes and what they mean. A lot of healthcare data, like electronic health records (EHRs), medical images, genetics, and personal sensor data, is being used more and more with machine learning methods like guided learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. These methods make it possible to use predictive models to diagnose diseases, give patients specific treatment suggestions, and keep track of their care. For sorting things into groups, supervised learning techniques like support vector machines (SVM) and random forests have been used to correctly spot diseases based on complicated data trends. For example, SVMs have been useful for telling the difference between different types of cancer from genetic data, which helps with focused treatments. On the other hand, unsupervised learning algorithms like grouping algorithms help find groups of patients who share similar traits, which makes personalized medicine possible. Deep learning, has been very successful in medical picture analysis, being more accurate than humans at tasks like finding tumors in x-rays and lab slides. Its ability to instantly learn traits from raw data has made diagnosis easier and more accurate. ML algorithms also help healthcare operations run more smoothly by using prediction analytics to help hospitals handle their resources better, make the best use of their staff, predict which patients will need to be admitted, and lower the number of times they have to be readmitted. These predictive models use a variety of data sources to guess how patients will do and how they will use healthcare resources, which helps people make smart decisions and make the best use of their resources.\n",

This study introduces an innovative approach, leveraging Linear regression model (LRM) and machine learning models, to dissect and predict the complex patterns of patient readmissions. This research is anchored in a robust methodology that encompasses the collection and preprocessing of data, application of LRM to distill the data into principal components, and the deployment of machine learning models on the transformed datasets. The core of this approach is the simplification of the multifaceted nature of healthcare data, enabling a deeper exploration of the determinants of readmissions. The findings of this research carry significant implications across several domains of healthcare, from clinical practice to policy formulation and resource management. By enabling more accurate patient risk stratification, healthcare providers can allocate interventions more effectively, concentrating efforts and resources on high-risk patients. Moreover, the insights derived from the analysis provide a strong evidence base for policymaking, aimed at addressing the underlying causes of readmissions. This facilitates the development of policies that can significantly impact patient care and healthcare system sustainability. A key outcome of this study is the advancement of personalized patient care. Through the identification of specific factors associated with readmissions, healthcare providers can create personalized care plans, reflecting a shift towards personalized medicine and improving patient satisfaction and outcomes.

Research indicates that ML-based models can accurately predict the impact of COVID-19 on Jordan's healthcare system, a concern now recognized as a potential global health threat. Specifically, to determine COVID-19 risk classifications, this study utilized three widely adopted forecasting models: support vector machine (SVM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and linear regression (LR). The findings reveal that applying these techniques in the current COVID-19 outbreak scenario is a viable approach. Results indicate that LR outperforms all other models tested in accurately forecasting death rates, recovery rates, and newly reported cases, with LASSO following closely. However, based on the available data, SVM exhibits lower performance across all predictive scenarios.\n",

      "   Abstract: With the large-scale language methods namely ChatGPT, there is a chance to explore the use of machine learning (ML) methods on ChatGPT-generated data for classifying healthcare data. Healthcare data classification gains more significance in extracting and organizing useful insights from the huge volume of medical data available. The ChatGPT-generated data has realistic and different healthcare-based text datasets that can be applied to training classification methods. ML approaches include supervised learning methods as support vector machines (SVMs), and random forests (RF), which can be implemented for classifying the healthcare data. The methods were trained on the ChatGPT-generated data that can be carefully validated and labelled with suitable classes related to the healthcare field. With this motivation, this article presents an automated healthcare data classification-using barnacles mating optimizer with a pyramid neural network (AHDC-BMOPNN) technique. The presented AHDC-BMOPNN technique examines the healthcare data effectually using an ML model with a feature selection process. Primarily, the AHDC-BMOPNN technique exploits min-max data normalization for scaling the input dataset. In addition, the butterfly optimization algorithm-based feature selection (BOA-FS) method is deployed for the selection of optimum feature subset. In this work, the PNN algorithm was utilized for the classification of medical data. Ultimately, the BMO-based hyperparameter tuning process takes place to boost the overall classifier results of the PNN technique. The empirical findings of the AHDC-BMOPNN approach was validated on ChatGPT generated dataset. The simulation values highlight that the AHDC-BMOPNN method and the diverse healthcare text data generated by ChatGPT enhance the ability to extract valuable insights and organize medical information effectively.\n",

      "   Abstract: Healthcare professionals are known to suffer from workplace stress and burnout, which can negatively affect their empathy for patients and quality of care. While existing research has identified factors associated with wellbeing and empathy in healthcare professionals, these efforts are typically focused on the group level, ignoring potentially important individual differences and implications for individualized intervention approaches. In the current study, we implemented N-of-1 personalized machine learning (PML) to predict wellbeing and empathy in healthcare professionals at the individual level, leveraging ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and smartwatch wearable data. A total of 47 mood and lifestyle feature variables (relating to sleep, diet, exercise, and social connections) were collected daily for up to three months followed by applying eight supervised machine learning (ML) models in a PML pipeline to predict wellbeing and empathy separately. Predictive insight into the model architecture was obtained using Shapley statistics for each of the best-fit personalized models, ranking the importance of each feature for each participant. The best-fit model and top features varied across participants, with anxious mood (13/19) and depressed mood (10/19) being the top predictors in most models. Social connection was a top predictor for wellbeing in 9/12 participants but not for empathy models (1/7). Additionally, empathy and wellbeing were the top predictors of each other in 64% of cases. These findings highlight shared and individual features of wellbeing and empathy in healthcare professionals and suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing modifiable factors to improve wellbeing and empathy will likely be suboptimal. In the future, such personalized models may serve as actionable insights for healthcare professionals that lead to increased wellness and quality of patient care.\n",

      "   Abstract: Computer-aided decision support systems (DSSs) are becoming popular in a variety of professions. Notably, medical DSSs assist healthcare professionals (decision makers) choose the optimal course of action (decisions) while treating patients. Such systems help decision-makers in situations when there is uncertainty in manual decisions due to lack of information or expertise. Choosing a suitable learning algorithm in a DSS is essential and affects its performance. Among machine learning (ML) algorithms, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are considered the most suitable framework for many classification tasks. In healthcare, an ML-based prediction system/DSS employs data (genetic profile or clinical characteristics) and learning algorithms to forecast target values, which may give promising results. However, improving prediction accuracy is a crucial step in making informed decisions. One can apply various preprocessing methods (cross validation, feature selection, bagging, boosting, etc.) to achieve this. For complex classification tasks like cancer, decision-makers can utilize the hybridization of classifiers to increase prediction accuracy. The presented study investigates the possibilities of improvements in the design of hybridized systems for DSSs to assist healthcare professionals in robust decision-making before, during, and after cancer diagnosis. Since the network weights and the activation functions are the two crucial elements in the learning process of an ANN, this study is organized to investigates the improvement in the hybrid system by selecting suitable features from gene expression microarray data and using these features to compute the more realistic initial weights instead of using random guesses as initial weights for ANN. The use of the proposed framework gives promising results (upto 6.67% gain in accuracy when compared to previous study (Table-5) while 10.43% increase in accuracy when compared to conventional ML classifiers (Table-4).\n",

Machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict hospital readmissions and risk-stratify patients, but thus far they have been limited in clinical applicability, timeliness, and generalizability. (2) Methods: Using deidentified clinical data from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) between January 2016 and November 2021, we developed and compared four supervised ML models (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost) to predict 30-day readmissions for adults admitted to a UCSF hospital. (3) Results: Of 147,358 inpatient encounters, 20,747 (13.9%) patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The final model selected was XGBoost, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.783 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.434.

Several Machine Learning (ML) based techniques already exist to predict doctors based on patient’s health conditions. However, it is essential to accurately recommend doctors to patients with low errors based on patients’ health conditions. Therefore, we propose a method that assigns quantitative importance (weight) to each feature using an ML technique. Moreover, we offer a framework to recommend doctors based on the similarity score and doctor’s skill score, which utilizes weight prediction to enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, on real-world datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated empirically by lowering the average loss by roughly 34% and 3% as compared to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), respectively. The outcome demonstrates that the algorithm can efficiently recommend doctors to patients compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

In recent years, deep neural networks have shown to be capable of producing results that considerably exceed those of conventional machine learning methods for various classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we provide an accessible tutorial of the most important supervised machine learning concepts and methods, including deep learning, which are potentially the most relevant for the medical domain. We aim to take some of the mystery out of machine learning and depict how machine learning models can be useful for medical applications. Finally, this tutorial provides a few practical suggestions for how to properly design a machine learning model for a generic medical problem.\n",

Machine learning and artificial intelligence have been employed by various healthcare providers, scientists, and clinicians in medical industries in the fight against COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption habit changes among healthcare workers in the United States during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. We utilize multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and models such as decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, Chi-Squared Test, mutual information, KModes clustering and the synthetic minority oversampling technique on a mental health survey data obtained from the University of Michigan Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research to investigate the links between COVID-19-related deleterious effects and changes in alcohol consumption habits among healthcare workers. Through the interpretation of the supervised and unsupervised methods, we have concluded that healthcare workers whose children stayed home during the first wave in the US consumed more alcohol. We also found that the work schedule changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic led to a change in alcohol use habits. Changes in food consumption, age, gender, geographical characteristics, changes in sleep habits, the amount of news consumption, and screen time are also important predictors of an increase in alcohol use among healthcare workers in the United States.\n",

Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as effective tools for uncovering novel biomarkers and improving predictive modelling capabilities. However, bias within ML algorithms, particularly regarding sex-based disparities, remains a concern. In this study, a supervised ML model was developed in order to predict 9 common biomarkers widely used in clinical settings. These biomarkers included triglycerides, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, uric acid, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, high-density lipoproteins and albuminuria. During the validation test, it was observed that the ML models successfully predicted values within 5 and 10% error of the actual values. Out of the 121 female individuals tested, the following percentages of predicted values fell within this 10% range: 93% for albuminuria, 86% for waist circumference, 76% for BMI, and the lowest being 64% for systolic blood pressure and blood glucose. For the 119 male individuals tested, the percentages were as follows: 92% for albuminuria, 96% for waist circumference, 91% for BMI, 74% for blood glucose, and 68% for systolic blood pressure. Triglycerides, uric acid, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and high-density lipoproteins all predicted lower than 50% for both male and female subgroups. Overall, the male subgroup had higher prediction scores than the female group. Graphical Abstract\n",

Machine learning (ML) has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for HAI surveillance. We compared manual surveillance with a supervised, semiautomated, ML method, and we explored the types of infection and features of importance depicted by the model. Methods: From July 2021 to December 2021, a semiautomated surveillance method based on the ML random forest algorithm, was implemented in a Brazilian hospital. Inpatient records were independently manually searched by the local team, and a panel of independent experts reviewed the ML semiautomated results for confirmation of HAI. Results: Among 6,296 patients, manual surveillance classified 183 HAI cases (2.9%), and a semiautomated method found 299 HAI cases (4.7%). The semiautomated method added 77 respiratory infections, which comprised 93.9% of the additional HAIs. The ML model considered 447 features for HAI classification. Among them, 148 features (33.1%) were related to infection signs and symptoms; 101 (22.6%) were related to patient severity status, 51 features (11.4%) were related to bacterial laboratory results; 40 features (8.9%) were related to invasive procedures; 34 (7.6%) were related to antibiotic use; and 31 features (6.9%) were related to patient comorbidities. Among these 447 features, 229 (51.2%) were similar to those proposed by NHSN as criteria for HAI classification. Conclusion: The ML algorithm, which included most NHSN criteria and >200 features, augmented the human capacity for HAI classification. Well-documented algorithm performances may facilitate the incorporation of AI tools in clinical or epidemiological practice and overcome the drawbacks of traditional HAI surveillance.\n",

The bulk of the initiatives are aimed at classifying illness onset and minimizing cases of maltreatment. As a supervised learning problem, its accuracy is mostly determined by the training data, which is labeled data on actual patients that is highly privacy-sensitive. Privacy leakage can occur at any point in the machine learning lifecycle, from model training through model deployment, and can lead to a membership inference attack, model inversion attack, and reconstruction attack. As a result, safeguarding users' privacy is critical in healthcare issues, but little has been done to satisfy this demand. In this paper, we propose differential privacy-based Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models on breast cancer classification and diabetes prediction. We evaluate the two models using the popular Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, and Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and depict the privacy requirement and model accuracy trade-off.\n",

Early detection of these illnesses can considerably enhance patient outcomes and lead proper treatment choices. Recently, supervised machine learning algorithms have emerged as potential techniques for anticipating cerebrovascular diseases utilizing numerous clinical indicators. This study compares the predictive performance of three supervised learning algorithms, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost, in the context of cerebrovascular disease prediction. The dataset utilized for training and evaluation comprises a variety of clinical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and medical history. Random Forest has the highest prediction accuracy of the three algorithms, at 99.93% for cerebrovascular diseases. This result demonstrates how effective and reliable Random Forest’s pattern detection algorithms are in this dataset. With a near accuracy of 97.94%, XGBoost exhibits a good capacity for prediction. Decision Tree nevertheless obtains an excellent accuracy of 97.53% despite somewhat inferior performance compared to XGBoost, making it a competitive choice for the prediction of cerebrovascular disease. These results outperform the most recent state-of-the-art results and show a considerable increase in accuracy when compared to existing methods. The study emphasizes how well supervised learning systems, in particular Random Forest, capture the complex relationships between clinical parameters for accurate predictions of cerebrovascular diseases. The outstanding accuracy of these models highlights their potential for accurate cerebrovascular prediction in clinical practice.\n",

      "   Abstract: Cognitive Workload (CWL) is a fundamental concept in predicting healthcare professionals' (HCPs) objective performance. The study aims to compare the accuracy of the classical model (utilizes all six dimensions of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)) and novel models (utilize four or five dimensions of NASA-TLX) in predicting HCPs' objective performance. We use a dataset from our previous human factors research studies and apply a broad selection of supervised machine learning classification techniques to develop data-driven computational models and predict objective performance. The study findings confirm that classical models are better predictors of objective performance than novel models. This has practical implications for research in health informatics, human factors and ergonomics, and human-computer interaction in healthcare. Findings, although promising, cannot be generalized as they are based on a small dataset. Future studies may investigate additional subjective and physiological measures of CWL to predict HCPs' objective performance.\n",

      "   Abstract: Objectives The Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) is used extensively to create algorithms that predict liver disease. Given the existing research describing demographic inequities in liver disease diagnosis and management, these algorithms require scrutiny for potential biases. We address this overlooked issue by investigating ILPD models for sex bias. Methods Following our literature review of ILPD papers, the models reported in existing studies are recreated and then interrogated for bias. We define four experiments, training on sex-unbalanced/balanced data, with and without feature selection. We build random forests (RFs), support vector machines (SVMs), Gaussian Naïve Bayes and logistic regression (LR) classifiers, running experiments 100 times, reporting average results with SD. Results We reproduce published models achieving accuracies of >70% (LR 71.31% (2.37 SD) – SVM 79.40% (2.50 SD)) and demonstrate a previously unobserved performance disparity. Across all classifiers females suffer from a higher false negative rate (FNR). Presently, RF and LR classifiers are reported as the most effective models, yet in our experiments they demonstrate the greatest FNR disparity (RF; −21.02%; LR; −24.07%). Discussion We demonstrate a sex disparity that exists in published ILPD classifiers. In practice, the higher FNR for females would manifest as increased rates of missed diagnosis for female patients and a consequent lack of appropriate care. Our study demonstrates that evaluating biases in the initial stages of machine learning can provide insights into inequalities in current clinical practice, reveal pathophysiological differences between the male and females, and can mitigate the digitisation of inequalities into algorithmic systems. Conclusion Our findings are important to medical data scientists, clinicians and policy-makers involved in the implementation medical artificial intelligence systems. An awareness of the potential biases of these systems is essential in preventing the digital exacerbation of healthcare inequalities.\n",

      "   Abstract: Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are amongst the most important automated defense mechanisms in modern industry. It is guarding against many attack vectors, especially in healthcare, where sensitive information (patient’s medical history, prescriptions, electronic health records, medical bills/debts, and many other sensitive data points) is open to compromise from adversaries. In the big data era, classical machine learning has been applied to train IDS. However, classical IDS tend to be complex: either using several hidden layers susceptible to overfitting on training data or using overly complex architectures such as convolutional neural networks, long-short term memory systems, and recurrent neural networks. This article explored the combination of principles of quantum mechanics and neural networks to train IDS. A hybrid classical-quantum neural architecture is proposed with a quantum-assisted activation function that successfully captures patterns in the dataset while having less architectural memory footprint than classical solutions. The experimental results are demonstrated on the popular KDD99 dataset while comparing our solution to other classical models.\n",

      "   Abstract: Background Infectious diseases not only cause severe health problems but also burden the healthcare system. Therefore, the effective treatment of those diseases is crucial. Both conventional approaches, such as antimicrobial agents, and novel approaches, like antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), are used to treat infections. However, due to the drawbacks of current approaches, new solutions are still being investigated. One recent approach is the use of AMPs and antimicrobial agents in combination, but determining synergism is with a huge variety of AMPs time-consuming and requires multiple experimental studies. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely used to predict biological outcomes, particularly in the field of AMPs, but no previous research reported on predicting the synergistic effects of AMPs and antimicrobial agents. Results Several supervised ML models were implemented to accurately predict the synergistic effect of AMPs and antimicrobial agents. The results demonstrated that the hyperparameter-optimized Light Gradient Boosted Machine Classifier (oLGBMC) yielded the best test accuracy of 76.92% for predicting the synergistic effect. Besides, the feature importance analysis reveals that the target microbial species, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the AMP and the antimicrobial agents, and the used antimicrobial agent were the most important features for the prediction of synergistic effect, which aligns with recent experimental studies in the literature. Conclusion This study reveals that ML algorithms can predict the synergistic activity of two different antimicrobial agents without the need for complex and time-consuming experimental procedures. The implications support that the ML models may not only reduce the experimental cost but also provide validation of experimental procedures.

There are limited studies utilizing machine learning approaches to predict HCPs' burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey consisting of demographic characteristics and work system factors was administered to 450 HCPs during the pandemic (participation rate: 59.3%). The highest performing machine learning model had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.81. The eight key features that best predicted burnout are excessive workload, inadequate staffing, administrative burden, professional relationships, organizational culture, values and expectations, intrinsic motivation, and work-life integration. These findings provide evidence for resource allocation and implementation of interventions to reduce HCPs' burnout and improve the quality of care.\n",

Recent research studies have shown that Twitter data can be used for various purposes such as monitoring illnesses, promoting health, analyzing sentiment, and potentially aiding in medical directing. However, detecting fitness-related tweets in the vast amount of data on Twitter can be difficult. This pilot study, therefore, aimed to classify patient text about drugs and disease-associated tweets into meaningful health-related segments. The unlabeled dataset is divided into several groups using an unsupervised learning technique called K-Means Clustering, using this first label the text and followed by a combination of neural networks and machine learning classifiers, they classified 32046 diabetes-related tweets and 161290 drug text lines into five groups. Approximately 66.38% of drug line text was classified as health-related, with 55.14% “treatment and medication”, 7.10% “prevention” and 4.14% “symptoms and causes”. Over 33% were categorized as “Other and News”. If we talk about the tweets as a dataset then the tweet was classified as health-related, with 44.30% “treatment and medication”, 7% “prevention” and 5.3% “symptoms and causes”. Over 56.10% were categorized as “Other and News. After this multiclass classification, we applied three machine learning and two deep learning models to find accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. Drug review was used as a dataset then SVM and LR models provided an accuracy of 98% and when tweets were used as a dataset then LR models provided an accuracy of 97%.

Therefore, the best way to enhance affected person results and lower related healthcare prices might be to prevent cardiac arrest. This remark highlights the significance of prediction models that continuously perceive excessive-risk individuals and assist healthcare providers in providing centered care to the appropriate patient at the appropriate time for the early identification of cardiac arrest patients who may need immediate medical attention.

      "   Abstract: Early diagnosis and classification of arrhythmia from an electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a significant role in smart healthcare systems for the health monitoring of individuals with cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, the nonlinearity and low amplitude of ECG recordings make the classification process difficult. Thus, the performance of most traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers is questionable, as the interrelationship between the learning parameters is not well modeled, especially for data features with high dimensions. To address the limitations of ML classifiers, this paper introduces an automatic arrhythmia classification approach based on the integration of a recent metaheuristic optimization (MHO) algorithm and ML classifiers. The role of the MHO is to optimize the search parameters of the classifiers. The approach consists of three steps: the preprocessing of the ECG signal, the extraction of the features, and the classification. The learning parameters of four supervised ML classifiers were utilized for the classification task; support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNNs), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and random forest (RF) were optimized using the MHO algorithm. To validate the advantage of the proposed approach, several experiments were conducted on three common databases, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT-BIH), the European Society of Cardiology ST-T (EDB), and the St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Techniques 12-lead Arrhythmia (INCART). The obtained results showed that the performance of all the tested classifiers were significantly improved after integrating the MHO algorithm, with the average ECG arrhythmia classification accuracy reaching 99.92% and a sensitivity of 99.81%, outperforming the state-of the-art methods.\n",

Spatial accessibility to healthcare services is an area of interest for health planners and policymakers. In this study, we focus on the spatial accessibility to four different types of healthcare services, including hospitals, pharmacies, clinics, and medical laboratories at Isfahan’s census blocks level, in a multivariate study. Regarding the nature of spatial accessibility, machine learning unsupervised clustering methods are utilized to analyze the spatial accessibility in the city. Initially, the study area was grouped into five clusters using three unsupervised clustering methods: K-Means, agglomerative, and bisecting K-Means. Then, the intersection of the results of the methods is considered to be conclusive evidence. Finally, using the conclusive evidence, a supervised clustering method, KNN, was applied to generate the map of the spatial accessibility situation in the study area. The findings of this study show that 47%, 22%, and 31% of city blocks in the study area have rich, medium, and poor spatial accessibility, respectively. Additionally, according to the study results, the healthcare services development is structured in a linear pattern along a historical avenue, Chaharbagh. Although the scope of this study was limited in terms of the supply and demand rates, this work gives more information and spatial insights for researchers, planners, and policymakers aiming to improve accessibility to healthcare and sustainable urban development. As a recommendation for further research work, it is suggested that other influencing factors, such as the demand and supply rates, should be integrated into the method.\n",

      "   Abstract: Human feelings are fundamental to perceive the conduct and state of mind of an individual. A healthy emotional state is one significant highlight to improve personal satisfaction. On the other hand, bad emotional health can prompt social or psychological well-being issues. Recognizing or detecting feelings in online health care data gives important and helpful information regarding the emotional state of patients. To recognize or detection of patient’s emotion against a specific disease using text from online sources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic detection of patient’s emotions in healthcare data using supervised machine learning approaches. For this purpose, we created a new dataset named EmoHD, comprising of 4,202 text samples against eight disease classes and six emotion classes, gathered from different online resources. We used six different supervised machine learning models based on different feature engineering techniques. We also performed a detailed comparison of the chosen six machine learning algorithms using different feature vectors on our dataset. We achieved the highest 87% accuracy using MultiLayer Perceptron as compared to other state of the art models. Moreover, we use the emotional guidance scale to show that there is a link between negative emotion and psychological health issues. Our proposed work will be helpful to automatically detect a patient’s emotion during disease and to avoid extreme acts like suicide, mental disorders, or psychological health issues.

      "   Abstract: ADHD is a prevalent disorder among the younger population. Standard evaluation techniques currently use evaluation forms, interviews with the patient, and more. However, its symptoms are similar to those of many other disorders like depression, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder, and these current diagnosis techniques are not very effective. Thus, a sophisticated computing model holds the potential to provide a promising diagnosis solution to this problem. This work attempts to explore methods to diagnose ADHD using combinations of multiple established machine learning techniques like neural networks and SVM models on the ADHD200 dataset and explore the field of neuroscience. In this work, multiclass classification is performed on phenotypic data using an SVM model. The better results have been analyzed on the phenotypic data compared to other supervised learning techniques like Logistic regression, KNN, AdaBoost, etc. In addition, neural networks have been implemented on functional connectivity from the MRI data of a sample of 40 subjects provided to achieve high accuracy without prior knowledge of neuroscience. It is combined with the phenotypic classifier using the ensemble technique to get a binary classifier. It is further trained and tested on 400 out of 824 subjects from the ADHD200 data set and achieved an accuracy of 92.5% for binary classification The training and testing accuracy has been achieved upto 99% using ensemble classifier.\n",

      "   Abstract: Smart information systems are based on sensors that generate a huge amount of data. This data can be stored in cloud for further processing and efficient utilization. Anomalous data might be present within the sensor data due to various reasons (e.g., malicious activities by intruders, low quality sensors, and node deployment in harsh environments). Anomaly detection is crucial in some applications such as healthcare monitoring systems, forest fire information systems, and other internet of things (IoT) systems. This paper proposes a Gaussian distribution-based supervised machine learning scheme of anomaly detection (GDA) for healthcare monitoring sensor cloud, which is an integration of various body sensors of different patients and cloud. This work is implemented in Python. Use of Gaussian statistical model in the proposed scheme improves precision, throughput, and efficiency. GDA provides 98% efficiency with 3% and 4% improvements as compared to the other supervised learning-based anomaly detection schemes (e.g., support vector machine [SVM] and self-organizing map [SOM], respectively).\n",

      "   Abstract: Abstract In developing countries, child health and restraining under-five child mortality are one of the fundamental concerns. UNICEF adopted sustainable development goal 3 (SDG3) to reduce the under-five child mortality rate globally to 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. The under-five mortality rate is 69 deaths per 1,000 live child-births in Pakistan as reported by the Demographic and Health Survey (2018). Predictive analytics has the power to transform the healthcare industry, personalizing care for every individual. Pakistan Demographic Health Survey (2017–2018), the publicly available dataset, is used in this study and multiple imputation methods are adopted for the treatment of missing values. The information gain, a feature selection method, ranked the information-rich features and examine their impact on child mortality prediction. The synthetic minority over-sampling method (SMOTE) balanced the training dataset, and four supervised machine learning classifiers have been used, namely the decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, naive Bayes classifier, and extreme gradient boosting classifier. For comparative analysis, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score have been used. Eventually, a predictive analytics framework is built that predicts whether the child is alive or dead. The number under-five children in a household, preceding birth interval, family members, mother age, age of mother at first birth, antenatal care visits, breastfeeding, child size at birth, and place of delivery were found to be critical risk factors for child mortality. The random forest classifier performed efficiently and predicted under-five child mortality with accuracy (93.8%), precision (0.964), recall (0.971), and F1-score (0.967). The findings could greatly assist child health intervention programs in decision-making.\n",

      "   Abstract: This paper presents an original method for studying the performance of the supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods, the A-Test method. The method offers the possibility of investigating the structural risk as well as the learning capacity of ML methods in a quantitating manner. A-Test provides a powerful validation method for the learning methods with small or medium size of the learning data, where overfitting is regarded as a common problem of learning. Such a condition can occur in many applications of bioinformatics and biomedical engineering in which access to a large dataset is a challengeable task. Performance of the A-Test method is explored by validation of two ML methods, using real datasets of heart sound signals. The datasets comprise of children cases with a normal heart condition as well as 4 pathological cases: aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary stenosis. It is observed that the A-Test method provides further comprehensive and more realistic information about the performance of the classification methods as compared to the existing alternatives, the K-fold validation and repeated random sub-sampling.\n",

      "   Abstract: COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV is no longer pandemic but rather endemic, with more than 651,247 people around world having lost their lives after contracting the disease. Currently, there is no specific treatment or cure for COVID-19, and thus living with the disease and its symptoms is inevitable. This reality has placed a massive burden on limited healthcare systems worldwide especially in the developing nations. Although neither an effective, clinically proven antiviral agents' strategy nor an approved vaccine exist to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic, there are alternatives that may reduce the huge burden on not only limited healthcare systems but also the economic sector; the most promising include harnessing non-clinical techniques such as machine learning, data mining, deep learning and other artificial intelligence. These alternatives would facilitate diagnosis and prognosis for 2019-nCoV pandemic patients. Supervised machine learning models for COVID-19 infection were developed in this work with learning algorithms which include logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, naive Bayes, and artificial neutral network using epidemiology labeled dataset for positive and negative COVID-19 cases of Mexico. The correlation coefficient analysis between various dependent and independent features was carried out to determine a strength relationship between each dependent feature and independent feature of the dataset prior to developing the models. The 80% of the training dataset were used for training the models while the remaining 20% were used for testing the models. The result of the performance evaluation of the models showed that decision tree model has the highest accuracy of 94.99% while the Support Vector Machine Model has the highest sensitivity of 93.34% and Naïve Bayes Model has the highest specificity of 94.30%.\n",

      "   Abstract: The social and financial systems of many nations throughout the world are significantly impacted by life expectancy (LE) models. Numerous studies have pointed out the crucial effects that life expectancy projections will have on societal issues and the administration of the global healthcare system. The computation of life expectancy has primarily entailed building an ordinary life table. However, the life table is limited by its long duration, the assumption of homogeneity of cohorts and censoring. As a result, a robust and more accurate approach is inevitable. In this study, a supervised machine learning model for estimating life expectancy rates is developed. The model takes into consideration health, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics by using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to data from 193 UN member states. The effectiveness of the model’s prediction is compared to that of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regressors utilized in earlier research. XGBoost attains an MAE and an RMSE of 1.554 and 2.402, respectively outperforming the RF and ANN models that achieved MAE and RMSE values of 7.938 and 11.304, and 3.86 and 5.002, respectively. The overall results of this study support XGBoost as a reliable and efficient model for estimating life expectancy. This work develops a model that takes into consideration health, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics in predicting life expectancy to address the limitations of traditional life expectancy models, such as the ordinary life table. The comparison of the effectiveness of the model’s prediction with that of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regressors is performed. The reliability and efficiency of XGBoost in estimating life expectancy is assessed and established to be superior to Random Forest model, with implications to societal issues and global healthcare administration.

      "   Abstract: The use of non-invasive tools in conjunction with artificial intelligence (AI) to detect diseases has the potential to revolutionize healthcare. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) is a technology that can be used to analyze biological samples in a non-invasive manner. This study evaluated the use of NIR spectroscopy in the fingertip to detect neutropenia in solid-tumor oncologic patients. A total of 75 patients were enrolled in the study. Fingertip NIR spectra and complete blood counts were collected from each patient. The NIR spectra were pre-processed using Savitzky–Golay smoothing and outlier detection. The pre-processed data were split into training/validation and test sets using the Kennard–Stone method. A toolbox of supervised machine learning classification algorithms was applied to the training/validation set using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation regimen. The algorithms included linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM model performed best in the validation step, with 85% sensitivity, 89% negative predictive value (NPV), and 64% accuracy. The SVM model showed 67% sensitivity, 82% NPV, and 57% accuracy on the test set. These results suggest that NIR spectroscopy in the fingertip, combined with machine learning methods, can be used to detect neutropenia in solid-tumor oncology patients in a non-invasive and timely manner. This approach could help reduce exposure to invasive tests and prevent neutropenic patients from inadvertently undergoing chemotherapy.\n",

Based on the k-anonymity and l-diversity supervised models, it is proposed to use the classified personalized entropy l-diversity privacy protection model to protect user privacy in a fine-grained manner. By distinguishing solid and weak sensitive attribute values, the constraints on sensitive attributes are improved, and the sensitive information is reduced for the leakage probability of vital information to achieve the safety of medical data sharing. This research offers a customized information entropy l-diversity model and performs experiments to tackle the issues that the information entropy l-diversity model does not discriminate between strong and weak sensitive features. Data analysis and experimental results show that this method can minimize execution time while improving data accuracy and service quality, which is more effective than existing solutions. The limits of solid and weak on sensitive qualities are enhanced, sensitive data are reduced, and the chance of crucial data leakage is lowered, all of which contribute to the security of healthcare data exchange.

      "   Abstract: Raised blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is considered a strong indicator of prediabetes or diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common non-communicable diseases (NCDs) affecting the adult population. Recently, the prevalence of diabetes has been increasing at a faster rate, especially in developing countries. The primary concern associated with diabetes is the potential for serious health complications to occur if it is not diagnosed early. Therefore, timely detection and screening of diabetes is considered a crucial factor in treating and controlling the disease. Population screening for raised blood sugar aims to identify individuals at risk before symptoms appear, enabling timely intervention and potentially improved health outcomes. However, implementing large-scale screening programs can be expensive, requiring testing, follow-up, and management resources, potentially straining healthcare systems. Given the above facts, this paper presents supervised machine-learning models to detect and predict raised blood sugar. The proposed raised blood sugar models utilize diabetes-related risk factors including age, body mass index (BMI), eating habits, physical activity, prevalence of other diseases, and fasting blood sugar obtained from the dataset of the STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor study collected from adults in the Palestinian community. The diabetes risk factor obtained from the STEPS dataset was used as input for building the prediction model that was trained using various types of supervised learning classification algorithms including random forest, decision tree, Adaboost, XGBoost, bagging decision trees, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Based on the experimental results, the raised blood sugar models demonstrated optimal performance when implemented with a random forest classifier, yielding an accuracy of 98.4%. Followed by the bagging decision trees, XGBoost, MLP, AdaBoost, and decision tree with an accuracy of 97.4%, 96.4%, 96.3%, 95.2%, and 94.8%, respectively.\n",

New developments in big data analysis tools, particularly those involving natural language, can be used to accurately and systematically evaluate the impact of the service. Objective: The study was intended to assess the predictive potential of eConsulta messages through different combinations of vector representation of text and machine learning algorithms and to evaluate their performance. Methodology: Twenty machine learning algorithms (based on five types of algorithms and four text representation techniques) were trained using a sample of 3559 messages (169,102 words) corresponding to 2268 teleconsultations (1.57 messages per teleconsultation) in order to predict the three variables of interest (avoiding the need for a face-to-face visit, increased demand and type of use of the teleconsultation). The performance of the various combinations was measured in terms of precision, sensitivity, F-value and the ROC curve. Results: The best-trained algorithms are generally effective, proving themselves to be more robust when approximating the two binary variables “avoiding the need of a face-to-face visit” and “increased demand” (precision = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively) rather than the variable “type of query” (precision = 0.48). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate a machine learning strategy for text classification using primary care teleconsultation datasets. The study illustrates the possible capacities of text analysis using artificial intelligence. The development of a robust text classification tool could be feasible by validating it with more data, making it potentially more useful for decision support for health professionals.\n",

      "   Abstract: Background Malnutrition imposes enormous costs resulting from lost investments in human capital and increased healthcare expenditures. There is a dearth of research focusing on the prediction of womens body mass index (BMI), and the malnutrition outcomes (underweight, overweight and obesity) in developing countries. This paper attempts to fill out this knowledge gap by predicting the BMI and the risks of malnutrition outcomes for Bangladeshi women of childbearing age from their economic, health, and demographic features. Methods Data from the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey and a series of supervised machine learning (SML) techniques are used. Additionally, this study circumvents the imbalanced distribution problem in obesity classification by utilizing an oversampling approach. Results Study findings demonstrate that support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor are the two best-performing methods in BMI prediction based on coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The combined predictor algorithms consistently yield top specificity, Cohens kappa, F1-score, and AUC in classifying the malnutrition status, and their performance is robust to alternative standards. The feature importance ranking based on several nonparametric and combined predictors indicates that socioeconomic status, womens age, and breastfeeding status are the most important features in predicting womens nutritional outcomes. Furthermore, the conditional inference trees corroborate that those three features along with the partners educational attainment and employment significantly predict malnutrition risks. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts BMI and one of the pioneer studies to classify all three malnutrition outcomes for women of childbearing age in Bangladesh, let alone in any lower-middle income country, using SML techniques. Moreover, in the context of Bangladesh, this paper is the first to identify and rank features that are critical in predicting nutritional outcomes using several feature selection algorithms. The estimators from this study predict the outcomes of interest most accurately and efficiently compared to other existing studies in the relevant literature. Therefore, study findings can aid policymakers in designing policy and programmatic approaches to address the double burden of malnutrition among Bangladeshi women, thereby reducing the countrys economic burden.\n",

Intrusion detection system must be updated frequently because of intrusions that improves periodically. Due to particular limitations such as resource-constrained devices, limited memory and battery capacity of nodes, and unique protocol stacks, traditional intrusion detection algorithms must be updated and improved for application to the Internet of Things. To address this issue, a lightweight attack detection approach based on supervised machine learning–based FIDS (Frothy Disturbance Intrusion Detection System) was developed to detect an adversary attempting to inject unneeded data into the network. FIDS can play an important role in intrusion detection. The proposed model was trained with KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Database) dataset using SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm. AODV (Ad-hoc- on-demand Distance Vector) routing protocol was used for routing to make it more energy efficient since the energy usable was limited. The process of packet transmission was done with the help of clustering algorithm to separate the sensors into groups with each group containing a cluster head.  \n",

The role of SML in stratifying patient-risk of infectious events during hospitalization and their performance using limited subsets of standardized and widely available predictors is less known. Using a large cohort of adult inpatients, we use SML techniques to predict a diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) during hospitalization. Methods We used previously validated data from adults (≥18 years old) hospitalized between 2009 and 2016 in a healthcare system as part of a federally funded study. The outcome was a UTI detected >2 days after admission. Predictors measured clinical complexity, history of healthcare-associated complications and specific risk factors for UTI. Predictors were restricted to those standardized and readily obtainable across facilities (e.g., ICD codes). Two SML methods, neural networks (NN) and decision trees (DT) were used. The NN used two hidden layers and a sigmoid output function. The DT used binary recursive portioning and Gini coefficient to measure node impurity. 60% of available hospitalizations were the training set, and 40% used as test set for validation. Cross validation was used to refine the model. Oversampling was used to adjust for the rare outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) for the test set measured model performance. Results From a total of 897,344 hospitalizations there were 16,069 UTIs identified from the data set during the study period. Applying NN and DT to the raw dataset, AUC’s of 0.55 and 0.69 were achieved respectively with the test set. Model performance for DNN and DT improved with oversampling to 0.77 and 0.78, outperforming traditional logistic regression (Figure 1). The optimal DT is presented (Figure 2). Conclusion Reasonable prediction performance for an infectious event during hospitalization was achieved using a limited set of routinely available and standardized variables. While both SML methods had comparable performance, the DT was more interpretable. Further work will extend these methods to other infectious events, use more specific EHR data and link these predictions to interventions in real time.

      "   Abstract: Perinatal mental health (PMH) problems are types of mood disorders which arise during pregnancy and within 24 months after the birth of a child, which affects pregnant women, newborns and family relationships. These problems may occur at any stage of maternal women. PMH is mainly diagnosed through behavioral observation, self-reporting, and behavioral scale testing. Chatbot is an effective technology. Through human-robot interaction, it can monitor the mental health status of perinatal women in real time while collecting user health data. The application of human-robot interaction in mental health services has attracted widespread attention. Compared with traditional methods, robot intervention in mental health care can help reduce the obstacles for subjects to seek help for mental health, and can collect more comprehensive and detailed data of patients, which helps users recognize their own mental health level, and can also help clinicians make diagnoses more accurately and in a timely manner. In this article, the author proposes a chatbot to monitor and assess the mental state of perinatal women. This article uses supervised machine learning to analyze the 31 characteristics of 223 samples, and trains a model to determine the anxiety, depression and hypomania index of perinatal women. Meanwhile, psychological test scales are used to assist in evaluation and make treatment suggestions to help users improve their mental health.\n",

      "   Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has revolutionized every aspect of everyday life by making everything smarter. IoT became more popular in recent years due to its vast applications in many fields such as smart cities, agriculture, healthcare, ambient assisted living, animal tracking, etc. Localization of a sensor node refers to knowing a sensor node's geographical location in the IoT network. In this research, we propose a device free indoor localization mechanism based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), a measure of the receiving signal from the sensor nodes, and supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. An experimental test-bed was implanted in a controlled environment to collect RSSI values from the sensor nodes. The RSSI levels were collected by using multiple and published to a remote MQTT server over the Internet. In this research, RSSI values were used to train supervised ML algorithms, Linear Regression (LR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) to estimate the accurate positioning of IoT related localization applications. The error between the actual measured values of the position and the estimated values are compared to validate the system model presented.\n",

      "   Abstract: Over time, technological advancements have had an immense effect on every aspect of life, including travel, office work, music, healthcare, and communication. In the past, people communicated using telephone lines. With far more functionality than telephone cable technology, wireless technology already prevails. SMS is mostly used by spammers and advertising firms to communicate with the general public and distribute company pamphlets. This explains why over 60% of spam SMS are sent and received every day. Although these spam communications irritate users and occasionally con unsuspecting users, the spammers and ad businesses benefit handsomely from them. This paper suggested a method for categorizing ham and spam SMS using supervised machine learning approaches. Features are extracted from data using feature extraction techniques like bag-of- words and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The imbalance in the SMS dataset we used was addressed by applying both oversampling and under sampling techniques. The support vector classifier, gradient boosting machine, random forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and logistics regression are implemented on the using spam SMS and ham SMS data sets, evaluated by F1 score, accuracy, precision and recall are used to assess performance. According to the experiment's findings, the random forest diagnoses spam and ham SMS more precisely-99% of the time.\n",
