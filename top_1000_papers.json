        "abstract": "Ophthalmology is a highly technical specialty, especially in the area of diagnostic equipment. While the field is innovative, the access to cutting-edge technology is limited with reference to the global population. A significant way to improve overall healthcare is to understand the needs and possibilities of all possible consumers when developing sophisticated and accurate medical devices. The Smartphone-based Keratograph (SBK), is an example of a new project that uses real world feedback, addresses an unmet medical need, and implements commercially available components to create a device that is affordable, portable and simplistic to operate. The long-term goal of the SBK is to collect data from users for supervised machine-learning. This machine-learning aspect will ultimately aid in the development of an artificial intelligence device to enable even earlier detection of keratoconus, especially in children and adolescents. Again, the ultimate goal of any medical device should be to improve patient care, and to make a significant improvement on vision healthcare for the global population, providing access to this technology is essential.",

        "abstract": "Background Mexico has one of the highest global incidences of paediatric overweight and obesity. Public health interventions have shown only moderate success, possibly from relying on knowledge extracted using limited types of statistical data analysis methods. Purpose To explore if multimodal machine learning can enhance identifying predictive features from obesogenic environments and investigating complex disease or social patterns, using the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey. Methods We grouped features into five data modalities corresponding to paediatric population exogenous factors, in two multimodal machine learning pipelines, against a unimodal early fusion baseline. The supervised pipeline employed four methods: Linear classifier with Elastic Net regularisation, k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The unsupervised pipeline used traditional methods with k-Means and hierarchical clustering, with the optimal number of clusters calculated to be k = 2. Results The decision tree classifier in the supervised early fusion approach produced the best quantitative results. The top five most important features for classifying child or adolescent health were measures of an adult in the household, selected at random: BMI, obesity diagnosis, being single, seeking care at private healthcare, and having paid TV in the home. Unsupervised learning approaches varied in the optimal number of clusters but agreed on the importance of home environment features when analysing inter-cluster patterns. Main findings from this study differed from previous studies using only traditional statistical methods on the same database. Notably, the BMI of a randomised adult within the household emerged as the most important feature, rather than maternal BMI, as reported in previous literature where unwanted cultural bias went undetected. Conclusion Our general conclusion is that multimodal machine learning is a promising approach for comprehensively analysing obesogenic environments. The modalities allowed for a multimodal approach designed to critically analyse data signal strength and reveal sources of unwanted bias. In particular, it may aid in developing more effective public health policies to address the ongoing paediatric obesity epidemic in Mexico.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a serious health problem that threatens various age groups, including children, teenagers, and adults. In 2021, the mortality rate due to diabetes mellitus reached alarming levels, making it a global threat, especially in Indonesia, where the number of patients reached 19.5 million. Efforts to address diabetes mellitus include early prediction of the disease's risk in patients, and machine learning approaches have shown potential in this regard. This study employs a quantitative method by utilizing secondary data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository titled \"Early Stages Diabetes Risk Prediction\". The data was obtained from questionnaires filled out by diabetes patients at Sylhet Diabetes Hospital and validated by healthcare professionals. A total of 520 data samples with 17 attributes were used for analysis. The tested Supervised Learning algorithms include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree C4.5, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The research findings reveal that the Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 98.71% in diagnosing diabetes mellitus. This study significantly contributes to enhancing the understanding of diabetes mellitus and has the potential for further development in finding the best algorithm for early disease prediction. It is hoped that this research will make a significant contribution to the efforts in preventing and managing diabetes mellitus, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients and reducing its impact on the population.",

        "abstract": "Background The demand for quality healthcare is rising worldwide, and nurses in South Africa are under pressure to provide care with limited resources. This demanding work environment leads to burnout and exhaustion among nurses. Understanding the specific factors leading to these issues is critical for adequately supporting nurses and informing policymakers. Currently, little is known about the unique factors associated with burnout and emotional exhaustion among nurses in South Africa. Furthermore, whether these factors can be predicted using demographic data alone is unclear. Machine learning has recently been proven to solve complex problems and accurately predict outcomes in medical settings. In this study, supervised machine learning models were developed to identify the factors that most strongly predict nurses reporting feelings of burnout and experiencing emotional exhaustion. Methods The PyCaret 3.3 package was used to develop classification machine learning models on 1165 collected survey responses from nurses across South Africa in medical-surgical units. The models were evaluated on their accuracy score, Area Under the Curve (AUC) score and confusion matrix performance. Additionally, the accuracy score of models using demographic data alone was compared to the full survey data models. The features with the highest predictive power were extracted from both the full survey data and demographic data models for comparison. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyse survey data according to the highest predictive factors. Results The gradient booster classifier (GBC) model had the highest accuracy score for predicting both self-reported feelings of burnout (75.8%) and emotional exhaustion (76.8%) from full survey data. For demographic data alone, the accuracy score was 60.4% and 68.5%, respectively, for predicting self-reported feelings of burnout and emotional exhaustion. Fatigue was the factor with the highest predictive power for self-reported feelings of burnout and emotional exhaustion. Nursing staff\u2019s confidence in management was the second highest predictor for feelings of burnout whereas management who listens to employees was the second highest predictor for emotional exhaustion. Conclusions Supervised machine learning models can accurately predict self-reported feelings of burnout or emotional exhaustion among nurses in South Africa from full survey data but not from demographic data alone. The models identified fatigue rating, confidence in management and management who listens to employees as the most important factors to address to prevent these issues among nurses in South Africa.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF) project has built a system to extract clinically significant information from the textual component of medical records in order to support clinical research, evidence-based healthcare and genotype-meets-phenotype informatics. One part of this system is the identification of relationships between clinically important entities in the text. Typical approaches to relationship extraction in this domain have used full parses, domain-specific grammars, and large knowledge bases encoding domain knowledge. In other areas of biomedical NLP, statistical machine learning (ML) approaches are now routinely applied to relationship extraction. We report on the novel application of these statistical techniques to the extraction of clinical relationships.ResultsWe have designed and implemented an ML-based system for relation extraction, using support vector machines, and trained and tested it on a corpus of oncology narratives hand-annotated with clinically important relationships. Over a class of seven relation types, the system achieves an average F1 score of 72%, only slightly behind an indicative measure of human inter annotator agreement on the same task. We investigate the effectiveness of different features for this task, how extraction performance varies between inter- and intra-sentential relationships, and examine the amount of training data needed to learn various relationships.ConclusionWe have shown that it is possible to extract important clinical relationships from text, using supervised statistical ML techniques, at levels of accuracy approaching those of human annotators. Given the importance of relation extraction as an enabling technology for text mining and given also the ready adaptability of systems based on our supervised learning approach to other clinical relationship extraction tasks, this result has significance for clinical text mining more generally, though further work to confirm our encouraging results should be carried out on a larger sample of narratives and relationship types.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Machine learning approaches are being developed to contribute to the treatment of patients and the organisation of care. These new approaches are created in complex environments that include data and computational models as well as new practices, roles and competencies. In such settings, individualised conceptions of agents bearing responsibility need rethinking. In response, we elaborate on the concept of epistemic responsibility based on De la Bellacasa\u2019s work on care (Bellacasa, M.P. de la. (2017). Matters of care: Speculative ethics in more than human worlds. University of Minnesota Press). To better understand these complex environments and the dynamics of responsibility, we use an ethnographic approach and followed Dutch healthcare professionals who learned the basics of (supervised) machine learning, while they pursued a project in their organisations during a four-month-long course. The professionals struggled with different interdependencies and this brought responsibility-in-the-making into relief. Rather than seeing (growing) relations and impure entanglements as standing in the way of responsibility, we show how connections are worthy of inquiry. We argue that connections are essential to knowledge and that producing epistemic responsibility means considering these embedded relations. In contrast to calls for control and clarification of machine learning techniques, and warnings that they create irresponsible black boxes, our care approach shows how responsibility-in-the-making reveals opportunities for ethical reflection and action. Our approach attends to how humans and non-humans are engaged in caring, reveals patterns around kinds of responsibility, and points to opportunities for avoiding neglect and irresponsibility.",

        "abstract": "Background Chronic spinal pain conditions affect millions of US adults and carry a high healthcare cost burden, both direct and indirect. Conservative interventions for spinal pain conditions, including chiropractic care, have been associated with lower healthcare costs and improvements in pain status in different clinical populations, including veterans. Little is currently known about predicting healthcare service utilization in the domain of conservative interventions for spinal pain conditions, including the frequency of use of chiropractic services. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to explore the use of supervised machine learning approaches to predicting one-year chiropractic service utilization by veterans receiving VA chiropractic care. Methods We included 19,946 veterans who entered the Musculoskeletal Diagnosis Cohort between October 1, 2003 and September 30, 2013 and utilized VA chiropractic services within one year of cohort entry. The primary outcome was one-year chiropractic service utilization following index chiropractic visit, split into quartiles represented by the following classes: 1 visit, 2 to 3 visits, 4 to 6 visits, and 7 or greater visits. We compared the performance of four multiclass classification algorithms (gradient boosted classifier, stochastic gradient descent classifier, support vector classifier, and artificial neural network) in predicting visit quartile using 158 sociodemographic and clinical features. Results The selected algorithms demonstrated poor prediction capabilities. Subset accuracy was 42.1% for the gradient boosted classifier, 38.6% for the stochastic gradient descent classifier, 41.4% for the support vector classifier, and 40.3% for the artificial neural network. The micro-averaged area under the precision-recall curve for each one-versus-rest classifier was 0.43 for the gradient boosted classifier, 0.38 for the stochastic gradient descent classifier, 0.43 for the support vector classifier, and 0.42 for the artificial neural network. Performance of each model yielded only a small positive shift in prediction probability (approximately 15%) compared to na\u00efve classification. Conclusions Using supervised machine learning to predict chiropractic service utilization remains challenging, with only a small shift in predictive probability over na\u00efve classification and limited clinical utility. Future work should examine mechanisms to improve model performance.",

The main objective of this study was to develop a generic machine learning (ML) algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes based on the number of reimbursements over the last 2\u2009years. Methods We selected a final data set from a population-based epidemiological cohort (i.e., CONSTANCES) linked with French National Health Database (i.e., SNDS). To develop this algorithm, we adopted a supervised ML approach. Following steps were performed: i. selection of final data set, ii. target definition, iii. Coding variables for a given window of time, iv. split final data into training and test data sets, v. variables selection, vi. training model, vii. Validation of model with test data set and viii. Selection of the model. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to select the best algorithm. Results The final data set used to develop the algorithm included 44,659 participants from CONSTANCES. Out of 3468 variables from SNDS linked to CONSTANCES cohort were coded, 23 variables were selected to train different algorithms. The final algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes was a Linear Discriminant Analysis model based on number of reimbursements of selected variables related to biological tests, drugs, medical acts and hospitalization without a procedure over the last 2\u00a0years. This algorithm has a sensitivity of 62%, a specificity of 67% and an accuracy of 67% [95% CI: 0.66\u20130.68]. Conclusions Supervised ML is an innovative tool for the development of new methods to exploit large health administrative databases. In context of InfAct project, we have developed and applied the first time a generic ML-algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes for public health surveillance. The ML-algorithm we have developed, has a moderate performance. The next step is to apply this algorithm on SNDS to estimate the incidence of type 2 diabetes cases.

In the latter, it was shown that knowledge of the smartphone location on pedestrians can improve the positioning accuracy. Most of the research conducted in this field is focused on pedestrian motion in a horizontal plane. In this research, we use supervised machine learning techniques to recognize and classify the smartphone mode (text, talk, pocket and swing) while accounting for the movement up and downstairs. We distinguish between the going up and the down motion, each with four different smartphone modes, making eight states in total. This classification is based on the use of an optimal set of sensors that varies according to battery life and the energy consumption of each sensor. The classifier was trained and tested on a dataset constructed from multiple user measurements (total of 94 min) to achieve robustness. This provided an accuracy of more than 90% in the cross validation method and 91.5% if the texting mode is excluded. When considering only stairs motion, regardless of the direction, the accuracy improves to 97%.

By examining the published literature, this review aims to explore the current applications of ML in MH research, with a particular focus on its use in studying diverse and vulnerable populations, including immigrants, refugees, migrants, and racial and ethnic minorities. Methods From October 2022 to March 2024, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and PubMed were queried. ML-related, MH-related, and population-of-focus search terms were strung together with Boolean operators. Backward reference searching was also conducted. Included peer-reviewed studies reported using a method or application of ML in an MH context and focused on the populations of interest. We did not have date cutoffs. Publications were excluded if they were narrative or did not exclusively focus on a minority population from the respective country. Data including study context, the focus of mental healthcare, sample, data type, type of ML algorithm used, and algorithm performance were extracted from each. Results Ultimately, 13 peer-reviewed publications were included. All the articles were published within the last 6 years, and over half of them studied populations within the US. Most reviewed studies used supervised learning to explain or predict MH outcomes. Some publications used up to 16 models to determine the best predictive power. Almost half of the included publications did not discuss their cross-validation method. Conclusions The included studies provide proof-of-concept for the potential use of ML algorithms to address MH concerns in these special populations, few as they may be. Our review finds that the clinical application of these models for classifying and predicting MH disorders is still under development.

        "title": "Statistical and Machine Learning Models for Classification of Human Wear and Delivery Days in Accelerometry Data",
        "abstract": "Purpose Accelerometers are increasingly utilized in healthcare research to assess human activity. Accelerometry data are often collected by mailing accelerometers to participants, who wear the accelerometers to collect data on their activity. The devices are then mailed back to the laboratory for analysis. We develop models to classify days in accelerometry data as activity from actual human wear or the delivery process. These models can be used to automate the cleaning of accelerometry datasets that are adulterated with activity from delivery. Methods For the classification of delivery days in accelerometry data, we developed statistical and machine learning models in a supervised learning context using a large human activity and delivery labeled accelerometry dataset. We extracted several features, which were included to develop random forest, logistic regression, mixed effects regression, and multilayer perceptron models, while convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, and hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network models were developed without feature extraction. Model performances were assessed using Monte Carlo cross-validation. Results We found that a hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network performed best in the classification task with an F1 score of 0.960 but simpler models such as logistic regression and random forest also had excellent performance with F1 scores of 0.951 and 0.957, respectively. Conclusion The models developed in this study can be used to classify days in accelerometry data as either human or delivery activity. An analyst can weigh the larger computational cost and greater performance of the convolutional recurrent neural network against the faster but slightly less powerful random forest or logistic regression. The best performing models for classification of delivery data are publicly available on the open source R package, PhysicalActivity.",

        "abstract": "Access to healthcare, including physiotherapy, is increasingly occurring through virtual formats. At-home adherence to physical therapy programs is often poor and few tools exist to objectively measure participation. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the potential for performing automatic, unsupervised video-based monitoring of at-home low-back and shoulder physiotherapy exercises using a mobile phone camera. Joint locations were extracted from the videos of healthy subjects performing low-back and shoulder physiotherapy exercises using an open source pose detection framework. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify physiotherapy exercises based on the segments of keypoint time series data. The model\u2019s performance as a function of input keypoint combinations was studied in addition to its robustness to variation in the camera angle. The CNN model achieved optimal performance using a total of 12 pose estimation landmarks from the upper and lower body (low-back exercise classification: 0.995 \u00b1 0.009; shoulder exercise classification: 0.963 \u00b1 0.020). Training the CNN on a variety of angles was found to be effective in making the model robust to variations in video filming angle. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a smartphone camera and a supervised machine learning model to effectively classify at-home physiotherapy participation and could provide a low-cost, scalable method for tracking adherence to physical therapy exercise programs in a variety of settings.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is one the most critical disease and suffered many people around the world. The efficient and correct detection of breast cancer is still needed to ensure this medical issue although the researchers around the world are proposed different diagnostic methods for detection of this disease, however these existing methods still needed further improvement to correct and efficient detection of this disease. In this study, we proposed a new breast cancer identification method by using machine learning algorithms and clinical data. In the proposed method supervised (Relief algorithm) and unsupervised (Autoencoder, PCA algorithms) techniques have been used for related features selection from data set and then these selected features have been used for training and testing of classifier support vector machine for accurate and on time detection of breast cancer. Additionally, in the proposed approach k fold cross validation method has been used for model validation and best hyperparameters selection. The model performance evaluation metrics have been used for model performance evaluation. The BC data sets have been used for testing of the proposed method. The analysis of experimental results has been demonstrated that the features selected by Relief algorithm are more related for accurate detection of Breast cancer instead of features selected by Auotencoder and PCA algorithms. The proposed method has been attained high results in terms of accuracy on selected feature selected by Relief algorithm and achieved 99.91% accuracy. We have been employed McNemar\u2019s statistical test for performance comparison of our different models. Further, the proposed method performance has been compared with baseline methods in the literature and the proposed method performance is high as compared to base line methods. Due to the high performance of the proposed method (Relief-Support vector machine) we highly recommended it for the diagnosis of breast cancer. In addition, the proposed method can be easily incorporated into the healthcare system for reliable diagnosis of Breast cancer.",

To date, one of the major aims of research is to find out a simplified non-invasive screening system for this still underdiagnosed disease. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ) is the most widely used questionnaire for OSA and is a beneficial screening tool devised to select subjects with a high likelihood of having OSA. We administered the original ten-question Berlin questionnaire, enriched with a set of questions purposely prepared by our team and completing the socio-demographic, clinical, and anamnestic picture, to a sample of Italian professional nurses in order to investigate the possible impact of OSA disease on healthcare systems. According to the Berlin questionnaire, respondents were categorized as high-risk and low-risk of having OSA. For both risk groups, baseline characteristics, work information, clinical factors, and symptoms were assessed. Anthropometric data, work information, health status, and symptoms were significantly different between OSA high-risk and low-risk groups. Through supervised feature selection and Machine Learning, we also reduced the original BQ to a very limited set of items which seem capable of reproducing the outcome of the full BQ: this reduced group of questions may be useful to determine the risk of sleep apnea in screening cases where questionnaire compilation time must be kept as short as possible.",

To date, the amount of research on the sitting posture detection on wheelchairs is very small. Thus, this study aimed to develop a sitting posture detection system that predominantly focuses on monitoring and detecting the sitting posture of a wheelchair user by using pressure sensors to avoid any possible discomfort and musculoskeletal disease resulting from prolonged sitting on the wheelchair. Five healthy subjects participated in this research. Five typical sitting postures by the wheelchair user, including the posture that applies a force on the backrest plate, were identified and classified. There were four pressure sensors attached to the seat plate of the wheelchair and two pressure sensors attached to the back rest. Three classification algorithms based on the supervised learning of machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) were used to classify the postures which produced an accuracy of 95.44%, 98.72%, and 98.80%, respectively. All the classification algorithms were evaluated by using the k-fold cross validation method. A graphical-user interface (GUI) based application was developed using the algorithm with the highest accuracy, DT classifier, to illustrate the result of the posture classification to the wheelchair user for any posture correction to be made in case of improper sitting posture detected.\nABSTRAK: Penggunaan pembelajaran mesin dalam sistem penjagaan kesihatan terutama dalam mengawasi pergerakan pengguna kerusi roda dapat membantu meningkatkan kualiti hidup bagi mengelak sebarang risiko serius seperti ulser disebabkan tekanan duduk terlalu lama di kerusi roda.

Despite these risks, long-term use remains common, presenting a public health concern. This study aims to explore the beliefs and opinions held by the public regarding benzodiazepines, as understanding these perspectives may provide insights into their usage patterns. Methods We collected public tweets published in English between January 1, 2019, and October 31, 2020, that mentioned benzodiazepines. The content of each tweet and the characteristics of the users were analyzed using a mixed-method approach, including manual analysis and semi-supervised machine learning. Results Over half of the Twitter users highlighted the efficacy of benzodiazepines, with minimal discussion of their side effects. The most active participants in these conversations were patients and their families, with health professionals and institutions being notably absent. Additionally, the drugs most frequently mentioned corresponded with those most commonly prescribed by healthcare professionals. Conclusions Social media platforms offer valuable insights into users\u2019 experiences and opinions regarding medications. Notably, the sentiment towards benzodiazepines is predominantly positive, with users viewing them as effective while rarely mentioning side effects. This analysis underscores the need to educate physicians, patients, and their families about the potential risks associated with benzodiazepine use and to promote clinical guidelines that support the proper management of these medications.

The healthcare sector is one of the sectors which took advantage of these solutions. Due to reasons such as the world\u2019s ever-expanding population, ongoing epidemics, and the emergence of new disease types, it is becoming increasingly difficult for a patient to benefit from health services quickly and to make an accurate diagnosis. At this juncture, artificial intelligence reduces the patient density in hospitals, enables patients to access accurate information, and allows medical students to practice by seeing new cases. In this study, a new and reliable dataset was created with disease information obtained from various sources under the supervision of a specialist medical doctor. Then, new patient histories were added to the dataset used in the previous study, the experiments were repeated with the same algorithms, and the accuracy score comparison was presented. The created dataset includes 2006 unique patient histories, 358 symptoms, and 141 diseases and we think it will be a valuable dataset for researchers who make developments using machine learning in the field of healthcare. Various machine learning algorithms have been used in the training process to predict diseases belonging to different branches of medicine, such as diabetes, bronchial asthma, and covid. Besides, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multilayer Perceptron, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms, we also studied popular boosting algorithms such as XGBoost and LightGBM. All algorithms were validated with cross-validation and performance comparisons were made with different performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. It is also the first study to achieve\nan accuracy score of 99.33% with a dataset that involves a greater number of diseases than the datasets used in the studies examined.",

        "abstract": "The use of metaverse technology in medical education and training has the potential to greatly enhance the way healthcare professionals learn, practice, and deliver care. In particular, the use of virtual reality simulations has shown promise in the field of Orthopaedic surgery. But what exactly is metaverse? The term \u201cmetaverse\u201d was coined by science fiction author Neal Stephenson in 1992 to describe a virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet. In the context of healthcare, metaverse technology refers to the use of virtual reality, interactive and other immersive technologies, such as augmented reality in real time, to create simulated environments for training, education, and clinical application. One of the main benefits of using metaverse technology in Orthopaedic education and training is the ability to provide immersive learning experiences that more closely mimic real-life surgical scenarios. For example, a study published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research found that virtual reality simulations were effective in training residents to perform total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The study found that residents who trained using virtual reality simulations had significantly better performance in a simulated TKA task compared to those who did not use simulations. Another study on the use of virtual reality simulation facilitated resident training in total hip arthroplasty (THR). Additional benefit of using metaverse technology in medical education is the ability to use limited resources more efficiently. Training on cadavers and in operating rooms can be costly and time-consuming, whilst simulations using metaverse allow for repeated practices without these constraints. A recent randomised control trial published in the BMJ found that using virtual reality simulations to train surgical trainee on laparoscopic surgery resulted in better proficiency in shorter time compared with traditional training methods. However, there are potential dangers and abuses of metaverse technology in medical settings. For example, there is a risk that students and surgical trainees may not fully understand the limitations of simulations and may have unrealistic expectations for their abilities in real-life surgical scenarios. Some aspects of these issues were highlighted in an earlier publication on the use of virtual reality simulators and training in laparoscopic surgery. This could potentially lead to adverse outcomes for patients. Hence, metaverse in clinical practice is a compliment/ adjunct to, and not a replacement for proper supervised surgical training. There is also the potential for abuse, such as cheating on exams or using simulations to practice procedures without proper supervision. In summary the use of metaverse technology in medical education and surgical training holds great promise for enhancing the way healthcare professionals learn, practice, and deliver care. However, it is important to carefully consider the benefits, drawbacks, potential dangers and abuses of this emerging technology. It is crucial that metaverse technology be used in a responsible, supervised, and ethical manner, in conjunction with formal surgical training, to ensure that healthcare professionals are properly prepared to deliver high-quality patient care.",

        "abstract": "Early diagnosis and classification of arrhythmia from an electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a significant role in smart healthcare systems for the health monitoring of individuals with cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, the nonlinearity and low amplitude of ECG recordings make the classification process difficult. Thus, the performance of most traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers is questionable, as the interrelationship between the learning parameters is not well modeled, especially for data features with high dimensions. To address the limitations of ML classifiers, this paper introduces an automatic arrhythmia classification approach based on the integration of a recent metaheuristic optimization (MHO) algorithm and ML classifiers. The role of the MHO is to optimize the search parameters of the classifiers. The approach consists of three steps: the preprocessing of the ECG signal, the extraction of the features, and the classification. The learning parameters of four supervised ML classifiers were utilized for the classification task; support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNNs), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and random forest (RF) were optimized using the MHO algorithm. To validate the advantage of the proposed approach, several experiments were conducted on three common databases, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT-BIH), the European Society of Cardiology ST-T (EDB), and the St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Techniques 12-lead Arrhythmia (INCART). The obtained results showed that the performance of all the tested classifiers were significantly improved after integrating the MHO algorithm, with the average ECG arrhythmia classification accuracy reaching 99.92% and a sensitivity of 99.81%, outperforming the state-of the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Background Malnutrition imposes enormous costs resulting from lost investments in human capital and increased healthcare expenditures. There is a dearth of research focusing on the prediction of womens body mass index (BMI), and the malnutrition outcomes (underweight, overweight and obesity) in developing countries. This paper attempts to fill out this knowledge gap by predicting the BMI and the risks of malnutrition outcomes for Bangladeshi women of childbearing age from their economic, health, and demographic features. Methods Data from the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey and a series of supervised machine learning (SML) techniques are used. Additionally, this study circumvents the imbalanced distribution problem in obesity classification by utilizing an oversampling approach. Results Study findings demonstrate that support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor are the two best-performing methods in BMI prediction based on coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The combined predictor algorithms consistently yield top specificity, Cohens kappa, F1-score, and AUC in classifying the malnutrition status, and their performance is robust to alternative standards. The feature importance ranking based on several nonparametric and combined predictors indicates that socioeconomic status, womens age, and breastfeeding status are the most important features in predicting womens nutritional outcomes. Furthermore, the conditional inference trees corroborate that those three features along with the partners educational attainment and employment significantly predict malnutrition risks. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts BMI and one of the pioneer studies to classify all three malnutrition outcomes for women of childbearing age in Bangladesh, let alone in any lower-middle income country, using SML techniques. Moreover, in the context of Bangladesh, this paper is the first to identify and rank features that are critical in predicting nutritional outcomes using several feature selection algorithms. The estimators from this study predict the outcomes of interest most accurately and efficiently compared to other existing studies in the relevant literature. Therefore, study findings can aid policymakers in designing policy and programmatic approaches to address the double burden of malnutrition among Bangladeshi women, thereby reducing the countrys economic burden.",

        "abstract": "Predicting the effects of mutations in proteins is critical to many applications, from understanding genetic disease to designing novel proteins that can address our most pressing challenges in climate, agriculture and healthcare. Despite a surge in machine learning-based protein models to tackle these questions, an assessment of their respective benefits is challenging due to the use of distinct, often contrived, experimental datasets, and the variable performance of models across different protein families. Addressing these challenges requires scale. To that end we introduce ProteinGym, a large-scale and holistic set of benchmarks specifically designed for protein fitness prediction and design. It encompasses both a broad collection of over 250 standardized deep mutational scanning assays, spanning millions of mutated sequences, as well as curated clinical datasets providing high-quality expert annotations about mutation effects. We devise a robust evaluation framework that combines metrics for both fitness prediction and design, factors in known limitations of the underlying experimental methods, and covers both zero-shot and supervised settings. We report the performance of a diverse set of over 70 high-performing models from various subfields (eg., alignment-based, inverse folding) into a unified benchmark suite. We open source the corresponding codebase, datasets, MSAs, structures, model predictions and develop a user-friendly website that facilitates data access and analysis.",

        "abstract": "End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) presents a significant public health challenge, with hemodialysis (HD) remaining one of the most prevalent kidney replacement therapies. Ensuring the longevity and functionality of arteriovenous accesses is challenging for HD patients. Blood flow sound, which contains valuable information, has often been neglected in the past. However, machine learning offers a new approach, leveraging data non-invasively and learning autonomously to match the experience of healthcare professionas. This study aimed to devise a model for detecting arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) stenosis. A smartphone stethoscope was used to record the sound of AVG blood flow at the arterial and venous sides, with each recording lasting one minute. The sound recordings were transformed into mel spectrograms, and a 14-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed to detect stenosis. The CNN comprised six convolution blocks with 3x3 kernel mapping, batch normalization, and rectified linear unit activation function. We applied contrastive learning to train the pre-training audio neural networks model with unlabeled data through self-supervised learning, followed by fine-tuning. In total, 27,406 dialysis session blood flow sounds were documented, including 180 stenosis blood flow sounds. Our proposed framework demonstrated a significant improvement (p<0.05) over training from scratch and a popular pre-trained audio neural networks (PANNs) model, achieving an accuracy of 0.9279, precision of 0.8462, and recall of 0.8077, compared to previous values of 0.8649, 0.7391, and 0.6538.

        "abstract": "Abstract In developing countries, child health and restraining under-five child mortality are one of the fundamental concerns. UNICEF adopted sustainable development goal 3 (SDG3) to reduce the under-five child mortality rate globally to 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. The under-five mortality rate is 69 deaths per 1,000 live child-births in Pakistan as reported by the Demographic and Health Survey (2018). Predictive analytics has the power to transform the healthcare industry, personalizing care for every individual. Pakistan Demographic Health Survey (2017\u20132018), the publicly available dataset, is used in this study and multiple imputation methods are adopted for the treatment of missing values. The information gain, a feature selection method, ranked the information-rich features and examine their impact on child mortality prediction. The synthetic minority over-sampling method (SMOTE) balanced the training dataset, and four supervised machine learning classifiers have been used, namely the decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, naive Bayes classifier, and extreme gradient boosting classifier. For comparative analysis, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score have been used. Eventually, a predictive analytics framework is built that predicts whether the child is alive or dead. The number under-five children in a household, preceding birth interval, family members, mother age, age of mother at first birth, antenatal care visits, breastfeeding, child size at birth, and place of delivery were found to be critical risk factors for child mortality. The random forest classifier performed efficiently and predicted under-five child mortality with accuracy (93.8%), precision (0.964), recall (0.971), and F1-score (0.967). The findings could greatly assist child health intervention programs in decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Computers that simulate human thought were first described in 1950, with the first artificial intelligence (AI) publication in 1943 describing a computer model that generated an autonomous binary output inspired by a human neuron (1). Since then, advances in machine learning and deep learning have expanded AI and created new paradigms in computer science. In healthcare, automatic processes facilitate diagnosis prediction, medical care, smart medical devices implementation, workflow improvement, electronic medical records interpretation, and screening programs (2, 3). Convolutional neural networks are examples of deep learning analytics applied to image processing; they simulate interconnected neurons and provide output after multiple interconnected information layers (2). Machine learning algorithms could be unsupervised, supervised, or reinforced; in every learning method, the construction of datasets is a critical step (3). More than twenty thousand articles have been published regarding AI in the last five years, with more than 1000 pertaining to ophthalmology. Regarding the retina subspecialty, AI has been applied in disease screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and retinopathy of prematurity (4). AI has already been applied in the IDx-DR system, the first FDA-approved device, with good results in Caucasian, North African, and Sub-Saharan populations (5). In the European Union, EyeArt has been used to exclude low-quality images, estimate DR progression, and recommend referral (5). Other algorithms, including Google\u2019s, Singapore\u2019s SERI-NUS, the Bosch DR Algorithm, and Retinalyze, have been developed (5). Algorithms have also been developed to support decision-making, e.g., in the anti-angiogenic treatment of AMD (6). Despite technological advances, many challenges hamper real-world implementation of AI, such as variability in algorithm performance, patient acceptance in automated processes, and ethical conflicts.

        "abstract": "This paper revolves around a classification use case of machine learning in which the intention is to predict\nthe possibility of a heart disease in an individual given certain parameters. Machine Learning is extensively\nbeing used across the world. The healthcare industry has also commenced leveraging these data driven\ntechniques. Machine Learning can play a vital role in predicting the likelihood of locomotor disorders, Heart\nailments and more such diseases because machine learning is well known for its use cases in classifying,\ncategorizing and predicting. Such information, if predicted well, can provide key foresight to doctors who can\nhence mould their diagnosis and course of treatment per patient basis. The main advantage of using machine\nlearning in healthcare is its ability to parse and process huge datasets which are beyond the scope of human\nabilities, and then accurately convert the derived analysis of that data into clinical insights that can aid\nmedical practitioners round the globe in planning stratergies for providing care to patients, ultimately leading\nto more promising results, reduced costs of care and last but not the least , increased patient satiation and\nresponse/recovery. To simplify and solve this problem, solutions were provided using multiple supervised\nlearning algorithms like logistic regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, random forests, decision trees, support vector\nmachines and K-nearest neighbours. The best accuracy was seen using random forests.",

        "abstract": "The technology for human activity recognition has become an active research topic in recent years as it has many potential applications, such as surveillance systems, healthcare systems, and human-computer interaction. In the research of activity recognition, supervised machine learning approaches have been widely used for activity recognition. However, the cost of collecting labeled sensor data in new environments is high. Furthermore, these methods do not work well in a cross-domain environment using conventional machine learning approaches. In this study, we proposed a transfer learning framework based on principal component analysis (PCA) transformation, Gale\u2013 Shapley similarity measurement, and Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence (JSD) feature mapping. Transfer learning aims to apply new information learned from the source domain to the target domain. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach performs better than the approach merely learned in the source environment. this study, we proposed a transfer learning framework to overcome these problems. The proposed framework consists of three steps: (1) extract seminal information from the source and target environments with principal component analysis (PCA) transformation, (2) measure the feature similarity with the Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence (JSD) algorithm, and (3) map features to a common space based on the Gale\u2013Shapley algorithm. The proposed transfer framework can be used to increase the recognition performance when the model is applied to a new environment where the training sample is insufficient. In addition, it can also reduce the effort of obtaining labeling data.",

        "abstract": "A heart attack also known as cardiac arrest, diversify various conditions impacting the heart and became one of the chief-reason for death worldwide over the last few decades. Approximately, 31% of total deaths globally are due to CVDs. It constitutes the pinnacle of chronic processes which involve complex interactions between risk factors which can and cannot be improved. Most of the instances or cases of cardiovascular diseases can be allocated to revisable risk factors where most of the instances are considered preventable. ML became the enhancing approach for the evolution of predictive models in health care industries and was decided to test various algorithms to check what extent their prediction scores estimate or ameliorate upon the results acquired. Researchers deploy various machine learning and data mining techniques over a set of enormous data of cardiovascular patients to attain the prediction for heart attacks before their occurrence for helping healthcare industries and professionals. This research comprises various Supervised ML classifiers like, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression that have been used to deploy a model for Myocardial Infarction prediction. It uses the existing datasets from the Framingham database and others from the database of the UCI Heart repository. This research intends to ideate the prediction for probabilities of occurrence of a heart attack in the patients. These classifiers have been deployed in pipeline approach of machine learning to attain the prediction using both ways i.e., without optimizations and feature transformations as well as vice-versa. The results impersonate that the Gradient Boosting classifier is achieving the highest accuracy score in such a way that prediction used by our model is of binary form in where 1 means a chance of heart attack and 0 means no chance. Some of the most influential attributes are chest pain type among which the typical angina is the most influential and asymptotic chest pain is least, cholesterol level in which the level greater than 200mg/dl are more prone, increased heart rate, thal, and age. It is concluded that premature heart attack is preventable in 80% of the total cases just by using a healthy diet along with regular exercises and not using tobacco products also the person who drinks more than 5 glasses of water daily are less likely to develop attacks. The medical checkup of Blood-pressure level, cholesterol level and heart rate on daily basis along with meditation can help you prevent the major heart attacks.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 pneumonia is a persistent worldwide health problem that usually affects the most vulnerable groups in society: the newborn and aged populations. Most of the current endeavors toward handling diagnosis and classification of pneumonia have used numerous techniques for machine learning and deep learning, with a particular focus on COVID-19 pneumonia. However, most of these techniques have raised concerns with regard to diagnostic precision as a result of the limited application of advanced algorithms, datasets whose validation is mostly inadequate and predictive capability. To address these limitations, our research introduces a deep learning-based approach by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which enhances the performance in classifying COVID-19 pneumonia. Salient features of the proposed method include a four-step process: first, data acquisition from a comprehensive chest X-ray dataset on GitHub; second, processing and analyzing the data through visual means like histograms and scatter plots; third, using CNNs supplemented with techniques for data augmentation in supervised learning; lastly, performance evaluation to benchmark against existing models. The present study uses features from X-ray images with the help of CNN's advanced pattern recognition capabilities in pursuit of achieving better generalization and precision in classification. The model achieved an accuracy of 85.70\\% and precision of 88.6%, which surpasses the existing techniques and thereby built the promise of improving the accuracy of the diagnostic process, hence, leading to improved care for the patients, and more so forms the foundation on which future AI-powered healthcare diagnostics are expected to take off.",

An experimental test-bed was implanted in a controlled environment to collect RSSI values from the sensor nodes. The RSSI levels were collected by using multiple and published to a remote MQTT server over the Internet. In this research, RSSI values were used to train supervised ML algorithms, Linear Regression (LR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) to estimate the accurate positioning of IoT related localization applications. The error between the actual measured values of the position and the estimated values are compared to validate the system model presented.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The theft of drugs from healthcare facilities, also known as drug diversion, occurs frequently but is often undetected. This paper describes a research study to develop and test novel drug diversion detection methods. Improved diversion detection and reduction in diversion improves patient safety, limits harm to the person diverting, reduces the public health impact of substance use disorder, and mitigates significant liability risk to pharmacists and their organizations. Methods Ten acute care inpatient hospitals across 4 independent health systems extracted 2 datasets from various health information technology systems. Both datasets were consolidated, normalized, classified, and sampled to provide a harmonious dataset for analysis. Supervised machine learning methods were iteratively used on the initial sample dataset to train algorithms to classify medication movement transactions as involving a low or high risk of diversion. Thereafter, the resulting machine learning model classified the risk of diversion in a historical dataset capturing 8 to 24 months of history that included 27.9 million medication movement transactions by 19,037 nursing, 1,047 pharmacy, and 712 anesthesia clinicians and that included 22 known, blinded diversion cases to measure when the model would have detected the diversion compared to when the diversion was actually detected by existing methods. Results The machine learning model had 96.3% accuracy, 95.9% specificity, and 96.6% sensitivity in detecting transactions involving a high risk of diversion using the initial sample dataset. In subsequent testing using the much larger historical dataset, the analytics detected known diversion cases (n = 22) in blinded data faster than existing detection methods (a mean of 160 days and a median of 74 days faster; range, 7-579 days faster). Conclusion The study showed that (1) consolidated datasets and (2) supervised machine learning can detect known diversion cases faster than existing detection methods. Users of the technology also noted improved investigation efficiency.",

The objective of our study is to characterize the relationship of critical care pharmacist workload in the ICU as it relates to patient-centered outcomes of critically ill patients. METHODS: Optimizing Pharmacist Team-Integration for ICU patient Management is a multicenter, observational cohort study with a target enrollment of 20,000 critically ill patients. Participating critical care pharmacists will enroll patients managed in the ICU. Data collection will consist of two observational phases: prospective and retrospective. During the prospective phase, critical care pharmacists will record daily workload data (e.g., census, number of rounding teams). During the retrospective phase, patient demographics, severity of illness, medication regimen complexity, and outcomes will be recorded. The primary outcome is mortality. Multiple methods will be used to explore the primary outcome including multilevel multiple logistic regression with stepwise variable selection to exclude nonsignificant covariates from the final model, supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, and Bayesian analysis. RESULTS: Our protocol describes the processes and methods for an observational study in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: This study seeks to determine the relationship between pharmacist workload, as measured by pharmacist-to-patient ratio and the pharmacist clinical burden index, and patient-centered outcomes, including mortality and length of stay.",

Since immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been approved for stage IIB and IIC melanomas, prognostic tools to identify patients at high risk of recurrence have become even more critical. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of machine-learning algorithms in predicting melanoma recurrence using clinical and histopathologic features from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We collected 1720 early-stage melanomas: 1172 from the Mass General Brigham healthcare system (MGB) and 548 from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). We extracted 36 clinicopathologic features and used them to predict the recurrence risk with supervised machine-learning algorithms. Models were evaluated internally and externally: (1) five-fold cross-validation of the MGB cohort; (2) the MGB cohort for training and the DFCI cohort for testing independently. In the internal and external validations, respectively, we achieved a recurrence classification performance of AUC: 0.845 and 0.812, and a time-to-event prediction performance of time-dependent AUC: 0.853 and 0.820. Breslow tumor thickness and mitotic rate were identified as the most predictive features.

The framework proposed to deal with imbalanced datasets for classification-based approaches using electronic healthcare records (EHR). We have utilized supervised ML methods to predict lung cancer inpatients LOS during ICU hospitalization using the MIMIC-III dataset. Random Forest (RF) Model outperformed other models and achieved predicted results during the three framework phases. With clinical significance features selection, over-sampling methods (SMOTE and ADASYN) achieved the highest AUC results (98% with CI 95%: 95.3\u2013100%, and 100% respectively). The combination of Over-sampling and under-sampling achieved the second-highest AUC results (98%, with CI 95%: 95.3\u2013100%, and 97%, CI 95%: 93.7\u2013100% SMOTE-Tomek, and SMOTE-ENN respectively). Under-sampling methods reported the least important AUC results (50%, with CI 95%: 40.2\u201359.8%) for both (ENN and Tomek- Links). Using ML explainable technique called SHAP, we explained the outcome of the predictive model (RF) with SMOTE class balancing technique to understand the most significant clinical features that contributed to predicting lung cancer LOS with the RF model.

Matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI\u2010TOF MS) is used by clinical microbiology laboratories to address the need for rapid, cost\u2010effective and accurate identification of microorganisms. We evaluated application of machine learning methods for differentiation of drug resistant bacteria from susceptible ones directly using the profile spectra of whole cells MALDI-TOF MS in 46 CRKP and 49 CSKP isolates. Methods We developed a two-step strategy for data preprocessing consisting of peak matching and a feature selection step before supervised machine learning analysis. Subsequently, five machine learning algorithms were used for classification. Results Random forest (RF) outperformed other four algorithms. Using RF algorithm, we correctly identified 93% of the CRKP and 100% of the CSKP isolates with an overall classification accuracy rate of 97% when 80 peaks were selected as input features. Conclusions We conclude that CRKPs can be differentiated from CSKPs through RF analysis. We used direct colony method, and only one spectrum for an isolate for analysis, without modification of current protocol.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) present a significant menace worldwide, causing about 17.9 million deaths annually which is roughly 32% of global mortality. Heart failure, which impacts over 550,000 individuals on a yearly basis, emerges as an urgent global health concern. The formulation of effective prediction techniques for heart failure proves to be imperative in lessening its repercussions. Linear and machine learning models are put into service to forecast heart failure utilizing a myriad of inputs, comprising clinical data. With the burgeoning population, the early detection and intervention for heart disease grow more complex. Heart disease prevalence has escalated to concerning levels, culminating in untimely deaths due to arterial plaque accumulation. The premature pinpointing of heart disease holds the potential to rescue many lives by upholding arterial wellness. Our research integrates supervised machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease presence, underscoring methods to enhance classifier efficacy. Null values within the dataset are managed through mean value imputation, whereas irrelevant attributes are expunged utilizing information-gain feature selection. By wielding breakthroughs in machine learning (ML), the key aim of this study is to design prognostic models for cardiovascular disease utilizing 12 clinical attributes. By capitalizing on a dataset offered by Davide Chicco and Giuseppe Jurman, encompassing 12 clinical features and 299 data points, the efficacy of three ML algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression is evaluated. Our examination discloses that Logistic Regression showcases the most outstanding accuracy and likelihood in foretelling cardio vascular disease presence.

        "abstract": "Raised blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is considered a strong indicator of prediabetes or diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common non-communicable diseases (NCDs) affecting the adult population. Recently, the prevalence of diabetes has been increasing at a faster rate, especially in developing countries. The primary concern associated with diabetes is the potential for serious health complications to occur if it is not diagnosed early. Therefore, timely detection and screening of diabetes is considered a crucial factor in treating and controlling the disease. Population screening for raised blood sugar aims to identify individuals at risk before symptoms appear, enabling timely intervention and potentially improved health outcomes. However, implementing large-scale screening programs can be expensive, requiring testing, follow-up, and management resources, potentially straining healthcare systems. Given the above facts, this paper presents supervised machine-learning models to detect and predict raised blood sugar. The proposed raised blood sugar models utilize diabetes-related risk factors including age, body mass index (BMI), eating habits, physical activity, prevalence of other diseases, and fasting blood sugar obtained from the dataset of the STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor study collected from adults in the Palestinian community. The diabetes risk factor obtained from the STEPS dataset was used as input for building the prediction model that was trained using various types of supervised learning classification algorithms including random forest, decision tree, Adaboost, XGBoost, bagging decision trees, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Based on the experimental results, the raised blood sugar models demonstrated optimal performance when implemented with a random forest classifier, yielding an accuracy of 98.4%. Followed by the bagging decision trees, XGBoost, MLP, AdaBoost, and decision tree with an accuracy of 97.4%, 96.4%, 96.3%, 95.2%, and 94.8%, respectively.",

Leveraging an initial diabetes risk prediction dataset from the University of California Irvine (UCI) ML repository, our research focused on supervised learning techniques, constituting 85% of the employed methods. The remaining 15% comprised unsupervised learning approaches, specifically association rules. A key contribution of this study lies in the development of an optimal prediction model utilizing supervised ML algorithms. The Boruta feature selection algorithm was employed to identify pertinent features, and the subsequent models were validated using a preprocessed dataset containing 10 attributes. Notably, the risk prediction models generated through random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) exhibited impressive average accuracies of 98.13%, 97.37%, and 97.22%, respectively, as determined via 10-fold cross-validation with 15 repetitions.

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) offers several supervised learning algorithms to build classifiers for developing accurate decision support systems. However, the selection of robust classifier for reliable decision making in healthcare domain is three-fold: accuracy, refraining for low confidence decisions, and the cost of decisions. In the field of medical science, there are costs associated with the incorrect and the refraining from decisions, which can have negative implications in devising adequate therapeutic interventions. For example, it may be life threating if a cancer patient is declared as healthy one (misclassification cost) or decision remains pending for some time (rejection cost). In this work we proposed the concept of Accuracy Rejection Normalized-Cost Curves (ARNCCs), which is an extension of Accuracy Rejection Curves (ARCs); a three-dimensional visualization technique to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of classification algorithms over different rejection regions and normalized-cost (NC) to select the robust classifier. ARNCCs method holds ARCs plot on two dimensions, in addition it computes NC at third dimension against ratio of false positive costs and ratio of rejection costs obtained at different rejection rates. The proposed three-dimensional graphs have the potential to answer a variety of questions regarding accuracy, rejection rate and NC of a classifier. Six publicly available cancer datasets (four breast cancer and two lung cancer) having clinical parameters obtained from ML repository of University of California, Irvine (UCI) were used to assess the performance of proposed ARNCCs in this study. Empirical results show that ARNCCs provide broad range of decisions to choose the desired parameters (accuracy, rejection rate and NC) for further necessary actions as compared to traditional ARCs method. ARNCCs framework has the ability to more logically compare the performances of classification algorithms in terms of accuracy, rejection rate and NC based scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In pervasive healthcare monitoring, activity recognition is critical information for adequate management of the patient. Despite the great number of studies on this topic, a contextually relevant parameter that has received less attention is intensity recognition. In the present study, we investigated the potential advantage of coupling activity and intensity, namely, Activity-Intensity, in accelerometer data to improve the description of daily activities of individuals. We further tested two alternatives for supervised classification. In the first alternative, the activity and intensity are inferred together by applying a single classifier algorithm. In the other alternative, the activity and intensity are classified separately. In both cases, the algorithms used for classification are k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The results showed the viability of the classification with good accuracy for Activity-Intensity recognition. The best approach was KNN implemented in the single classifier alternative, which resulted in 79% of accuracy. Using two classifiers, the result was 97% accuracy for activity recognition (Random Forest), and 80% for intensity recognition (KNN), which resulted in 78% for activity-intensity coupled. These findings have potential applications to improve the contextualized evaluation of movement by health professionals in the form of a decision system with expert rules.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a large dataset of medical records, including patient demographics, clinical measurements, and laboratory results, is employed to develop a robust deep learning model. The model utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract valuable features from multi-modal data sources. These data sources encompass medical images (such as retinal scans and ultrasounds), textual information (patient history, symptoms, and lab reports), and genetic markers. The proposed deep learning model employs both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. In the supervised phase, the model is trained on labeled data to predict diabetes status accurately. The unsupervised phase leverages the power of deep autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discover latent representations of data, aiding in feature extraction and anomaly detection. The evaluation of the model is conducted on a separate dataset, and its performance is compared to existing diagnostic methods, including traditional clinical assessments and machine learning approaches. The results demonstrate superior accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in diabetes diagnosis, showcasing the potential of deep learning for improving healthcare outcomes.",

This research study aims at comparing five algorithms of supervised machine learning for the CAD prediction. The research utilizes the Cleveland dataset from the UCI repository for training and testing the algorithms. The results of the comparison revealed that KNN is the best algorithm with significant performance measures which can be effective in predicting CAD accurately.

Nursing best practices prevent pressure injuries, including time-consuming, complex tasks that lack payment incentives. The Braden Scale is an evidence-based stratification tool nurses use daily to assess pressure-injury risk. Our objective was to analyse the cost-utility of performing repeated risk-assessment for pressure-injury prevention in all patients or high-risk groups. Design Cost-utility analysis using Markov modelling from US societal and healthcare sector perspectives within a 1-year time horizon. Setting Patient-level longitudinal data on 34\u2009787 encounters from an academic hospital electronic health record (EHR) between 2011 and 2014, including daily Braden scores. Supervised machine learning simulated age-adjusted transition probabilities between risk levels and pressure injuries. Participants Hospitalised adults with Braden scores classified into five risk levels: very high risk (6\u20139), high risk (10\u201311), moderate risk (12\u201314), at-risk (15\u201318), minimal risk (19\u201323). Interventions Standard care, repeated risk assessment in all risk levels or only repeated risk assessment in high-risk strata based on machine-learning simulations. Main outcome measures Costs (2016 $US) of pressure-injury treatment and prevention, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) related to pressure injuries were weighted by transition probabilities to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at $100\u2009000/QALY willingness-to-pay. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model uncertainty. Results Simulating prevention for all patients yielded greater QALYs at higher cost from societal and healthcare sector perspectives, equating to ICERs of $2000/QALY and $2142/QALY, respectively. Risk-stratified follow-up in patients with Braden scores <15 dominated standard care. Prevention for all patients was cost-effective in >99% of probabilistic simulations. Conclusion Our analysis using EHR data maintains that pressure-injury prevention for all inpatients is cost-effective. Hospitals should invest in nursing compliance with international prevention guidelines.",

However, machine learning (ML) models to predict COVID-19 hospitalization in Asian children are lacking. This study aimed to develop and validate ML models to predict pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization. We collected secondary data with 2200 patients and 65 variables from Malaysian aged 0 to 12 with COVID-19 between 1st February 2020 and 31st March 2022. The sample was partitioned into training, internal, and external validation groups. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed for feature selection, and we trained seven supervised classifiers. Grid Search was used to optimize the hyperparameters of each algorithm. The study analyzed 1988 children and 30 study variables after data were processed. The RFE algorithm selected 12 highly predicted variables for COVID-19 hospitalization, including age, male sex, fever, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, body temperature, chest indrawing, and abnormal breath sounds. With external validation, Adaptive Boosting was the highest-performing classifier (AUROC\u2009=\u20090.95) to predict COVID-19 hospital admission in children. We validated AdaBoost as the best to predict COVID-19 hospitalization among children. This model may assist front-line clinicians in making medical disposition decisions.",

        "title": "Sparsifying machine learning models identify stable subsets of predictive features for behavioral detection of autism",
        "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis can be delayed due in part to the time required for administration of standard exams, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Shorter and potentially mobilized approaches would help to alleviate bottlenecks in the healthcare system. Previous work using machine learning suggested that a subset of the behaviors measured by ADOS can achieve clinically acceptable levels of accuracy. Here we expand on this initial work to build sparse models that have higher potential to generalize to the clinical population.MethodsWe assembled a collection of score sheets for two ADOS modules, one for children with phrased speech (Module 2; 1319 ASD cases, 70 controls) and the other for children with verbal fluency (Module 3; 2870 ASD cases, 273 controls). We used sparsity/parsimony enforcing regularization techniques in a nested cross validation grid search to select features for 17 unique supervised learning models, encoding missing values as additional indicator features. We augmented our feature sets with gender and age to train minimal and interpretable classifiers capable of robust detection of ASD from non-ASD.ResultsBy applying 17 unique supervised learning methods across 5 classification families tuned for sparse use of features and to be within 1 standard error of the optimal model, we find reduced sets of 10 and 5 features used in a majority of models. We tested the performance of the most interpretable of these sparse models, including Logistic Regression with L2 regularization or Linear SVM with L1 regularization. We obtained an area under the ROC curve of 0.95 for ADOS Module 3 and 0.93 for ADOS Module 2 with less than or equal to 10 features.ConclusionsThe resulting models provide improved stability over previous machine learning efforts to minimize the time complexity of autism detection due to regularization and a small parameter space. These robustness techniques yield classifiers that are sparse, interpretable and that have potential to generalize to alternative modes of autism screening, diagnosis and monitoring, possibly including analysis of short home videos.",

        "abstract": "Background: \nDiabetes is one of the dangerous and silent illnesses that cause sudden death. It can occur at any time and may cause great injury to the organs of the body or damage them completely. So, we must investigate this disease at the beginning of its appearance and before it gets hard to treat. With the fast advancement of Machine Learning (ML), these approaches enhanced the efficiency of decision processes in a wide range of applications, including medical diagnostics. \nMaterials and Methods: \nIn this paper, we chose a medical application field and used supervised machine learning algorithms to construct a high-accuracy prediction model for diabetes in humans at an early stage, before it progresses to the point of morbidity or fatality. The suggested model can extract hidden knowledge from diabetes-related data gathered from the Kaggle machine learning repository. We utilize Microsoft Azure ML Studio to model these ML algorithms. \nResults: \nThis study will benefit the health industry by offering users an online tool (i.e., web service) that allows them to input data and receive results that predict whether or not the person has diabetes. As a result, prior knowledge and ongoing monitoring of their diabetic health state will lower the risk of complications, morbidity, and death caused by this illness. After running numerous experiments with the classifier models to evaluate the proposed system, several performance indicators, including Recall, Precision, Accuracy, and f1-score, are measured for comparison. Based on the classification output, it was determined that Decision Forest is a better strategy and produces better results than the other ML approaches. \nConclusion: \nThe suggested system's key contribution is to improve healthcare quality, minimize hospitalizations, and lower the high expenditures of healthcare and drugs.\u00a0",

        "abstract": "For personalized healthcare, the purpose of this study was to examine the key genes and metabolites in the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway and their interactions as predictors of colorectal cancer (CRC) in multi-ethnic families. In this proof-of-concept study, we included a total of 30 participants, 15 CRC cases and 15 matched family/friends representing major ethnic groups in southern California. Analytics based on supervised machine learning were applied, with the target variable being specified as cancer, including the ensemble method and generalized regression (GR) prediction. Elastic Net with Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion with correction (AICc) and Leave-One-Out cross validation GR methods were used to validate the results for enhanced optimality, prediction, and reproducibility. The results revealed that despite some family members sharing genetic heritage, the CRC group had greater combined gene polymorphism-mutations than the family controls (p < 0.1) for five genes including MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, MTR A2756G, MTRR A66G, and DHFR 19bp. Blood metabolites including homocysteine (7 \u00b5mol/L), methyl-folate (40 nmol/L) with total gene mutations (\u22654); age (51 years) and vegetable intake (2 cups), and interactions of gene mutations and methylmalonic acid (MMA) (400 nmol/L) were significant predictors (all p < 0.0001) using the AICc. The results were validated by a 3% misclassification rate, AICc of 26, and >99% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. These results point to the important roles of blood metabolites as potential markers in the prevention of CRC. Future intervention studies can be designed to target the ways to mitigate the enzyme-metabolite deficiencies in the OCM pathway to prevent cancer.",

        "title": "A survey on diabetes risk prediction using machine learning approaches",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition that can lead to a variety of consequences. Diabetes is a condition that is caused by factors such as age, lack of exercise, sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and stress, poor food, and so on. Diabetics are at a higher risk of developing diseases such as heart disease, nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy), eye problems (diabetic retinopathy), kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy), stroke, and so on. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 382 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. By 2035, this number will have risen to 592 million. Every day, a large number of people become victims, and many are ignorant whether they have it or not. It primarily affects individuals between the ages of 25 and 74 years. If diabetes is left untreated and undiagnosed, it can lead to a slew of complications. The emergence of machine learning approaches, on the other hand, solves this crucial issue. Aims and Objectives: The aim was to study the DM and analyze how machine learning algorithms are used to identify the diabetes mellitus at an early stage, which is one of the most serious metabolic disorders in the world today. Methods and Materials: Data was obtained from databases such as Pubmed, IEEE xplore, and INSPEC,and from other secondary sources and primary sources in which methods based on machine learning approaches used in healthcare to predict diabetes at an early stage are reported. Results: After surveying various research papers, it was found that machine learning classification algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) etc shows the best accuracy for predicting diabetes at an early stage. Conclusion: Early detection of diabetes is critical for effective therapy. Many people have no idea whether or not they have it. The full assessment of Machine learning approaches for early diabetes prediction and how to apply a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the dataset to achieve the best accuracy are addressed in this paper.. Furthermore, the work will be expanded and refined to create a more precise and general predictive model for diabetes risk prediction at an early stage. Different metrics can be used to assess performance and for accurate diabetic diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Advances in technology and artificial intelligence (smart healthcare) open up a range of possibilities for precision intervention in the field of health sciences. The objectives of this study were to analyse the functionality of using supervised (prediction and classification) and unsupervised (clustering) machine learning techniques to analyse results related to the development of functional skills in patients at developmental ages of 0\u20136 years. We worked with a sample of 113 patients, of whom 49 were cared for in a specific centre for people with motor impairments (Group 1) and 64 were cared for in a specific early care programme for patients with different impairments (Group 2). The results indicated that in Group 1, chronological age predicted the development of functional skills at 85% and in Group 2 at 65%. The classification variable detected was functional development in the upper extremities. Two clusters were detected within each group that allowed us to determine the patterns of functional development in each patient with respect to functional skills. The use of smart healthcare resources has a promising future in the field of early care. However, data recording in web applications needs to be planned, and the automation of results through machine learning techniques is required.",

        "title": "The Diagnosis of Dengue in Patients Presenting With Acute Febrile Illness Using Supervised Machine Learning and Impact of Seasonality",
        "abstract": "Background Symptomatic dengue infection can result in a life-threatening shock syndrome and timely diagnosis is essential. Point-of-care tests for non-structural protein 1 and IgM are used widely but performance can be limited. We developed a supervised machine learning model to predict whether patients with acute febrile illnesses had a diagnosis of dengue or other febrile illnesses (OFI). The impact of seasonality on model performance over time was examined. Methods We analysed data from a prospective observational clinical study in Vietnam. Enrolled patients presented with an acute febrile illness of <72 h duration. A gradient boosting model (XGBoost) was used to predict final diagnosis using age, sex, haematocrit, platelet, white cell, and lymphocyte count collected on enrolment. Data was randomly split 80/20% into a training and hold-out set, respectively, with the latter not used in model development. Cross-validation and hold out set testing was used, with performance over time evaluated through a rolling window approach. Results We included 8,100 patients recruited between 16th October 2010 and 10th December 2014. In total 2,240 (27.7%) patients were diagnosed with dengue infection. The optimised model from training data had an overall median area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.86 (interquartile range 0.84\u20130.86), specificity of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.56, positive predictive value of 0.73, negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.84, and Brier score of 0.13 in predicting the final diagnosis, with similar performances in hold-out set testing (AUROC of 0.86). Model performances varied significantly over time as a function of seasonality and other factors. Incorporation of a dynamic threshold which continuously learns from recent cases resulted in a more consistent performance throughout the year (NPV >90%). Conclusion Supervised machine learning models are able to discriminate between dengue and OFI diagnoses in patients presenting with an early undifferentiated febrile illness. These models could be of clinical utility in supporting healthcare decision-making and provide passive surveillance across dengue endemic regions. Effects of seasonality and changing disease prevalence must however be taken into account\u2014this is of significant importance given unpredictable effects of human-induced climate change and the impact on health.",

Further objectives include identifying states with similar values of identified factors and their geographical concentration. This is exploratory research and is a quantitative research study according to the type of data used. Using the supervised machine learning random forest algorithm, we predict the number of COVID-19 deaths depending on analyzed factors. From 23 factors, we choose the seven most important factors. This selection is based on the highest value, Inc Node Purity. The cluster analysis is used to create groups of states with similar values of chosen factors. Because of the nonuniform methodology of reported deaths, we use excess mortality to measure COVID-19 mortality. The most important factor influencing COVID-19 mortality is the death rate due to circulatory system diseases. The second most significant factor is the avoidable mortality. The third most relevant factor is GDP per capita in purchasing power parity. Similar values of analyzed factors can be found in Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, Croatia, and Latvia. COVID-19 mortality in these countries is almost three times higher than in the rest of the EU. Decision-makers could use the gained findings to decrease inequalities in the field of healthcare, mostly through efficient interventions in public healthcare and primary prevention. The results demonstrate that more investment in promoting health in the future will be necessary in the cohesion policy framework.",

The current human dependence on technology has contributed to the problem even more, with the effects visibly pronounced in late teenagers and early adults. Researchers till date, have tried numerous ways to determine the factors that cause obesity in early adults. On that frontier, our hybrid machine-learning model uses the help of some supervised and unsupervised data mining methods like Extremely Randomized Trees, Multilayer Perceptron and XGBoost using Python to detect and predict obesity levels and help healthcare professionals to combat this phenomenon. Our dataset is a publicly available dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing the data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The proposed model heavily utilizes feature engineering methods and introduces the concept of a hybrid model. This work has shown improved results over prior works and extensive studies have been undertaken to preserve the robustness of this model.",

        "abstract": "Malaysia has reported no indigenous cases of P. falciparum and P. vivax for over 3\u00a0years. When transmission reaches such low levels, it is important to understand the individuals and locations where exposure risks are high, as they may be at greater risk in the case of a resurgence of transmission. Serology is a useful tool in low transmission settings, providing insight into exposure over longer durations than PCR or RDT. We ran blood samples from a 2015 population-based survey in northern Sabah, Malaysian Borneo on a multiplex bead assay. Using supervised machine learning methods, we characterised recent and historic exposure to Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax and found recent exposure to P. falciparum to be very low, with exposure to both species increasing with age. We performed a risk-factor assessment on environmental, behavioural, demographic and household factors, and identified forest activity and longer travel times to healthcare as common risk-factors for exposure to P. falciparum and P. vivax. In addition, we used remote-sensing derived data and geostatistical models to assess environmental and spatial associations with exposure. We created predictive maps of exposure to recent P. falciparum in the study area and showed 3 clear foci of exposure. This study provides useful insight into the environmental, spatial and demographic risk factors for P. falciparum and P. vivax at a period of low transmission in Malaysian Borneo. The findings would be valuable in the case of resurgence of human malarias in the region.",

        "abstract": "Information and communication technology (ICT) advancements have altered the entire computing paradigm. As a result of these improvements, numerous new channels of communication are being created, one of which is the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT has recently emerged as cutting-edge technology for creating smart environments. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a subset of the IoT, in which medical equipment exchange information with each other to exchange sensitive information. These developments enable the healthcare business to maintain a higher level of touch and care for its patients. Security is seen as a significant challenge in whatsoever technology\u2019s reliance based on the IoT. Security difficulties occur owing to the various potential attacks posed by attackers. There are numerous security concerns, such as remote hijacking, impersonation, denial of service attacks, password guessing, and man-in-the-middle. In the event of such attacks, critical data associated with IoT connectivity may be revealed, altered, or even rendered inaccessible to authorized users. As a result, it turns out to be critical to safeguard the IoT/IoMT ecosystem against malware assaults. The main goal of this study is to demonstrate how a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and supervised machine learning models (random forest, decision tree, KNN, and ridge classifier) can be utilized to develop an efficient and effective IDS in the IoMT environment for classifying and forecasting unexpected cyber threats. Preprocessing and normalization of network data are performed. Following that, we optimized features using a bio-inspired particle swarm algorithm. On the standard data for intrusion detection, a thorough evaluation of experiments in DRNN and other SML is performed. It was established through rigorous testing that the proposed SML model outperforms existing approaches with an accuracy of 99.76%.",

The aim of this study was to develop an automated system allowing to code ADRs from patient reports. Our system was based on a knowledge base about drugs, enriched by supervised machine learning (ML) models trained on patients reporting data. To train our models, we selected all cases of ADRs reported by patients to a French Pharmacovigilance Centre through a national web\u2010portal between March 2017 and March 2019 (n = 2,058 reports). We tested both conventional ML models and deep\u2010learning models.

        "abstract": "Background: Machine learning is used to analyze big data, often for the purposes of prediction. Analyzing a patient\u2019s healthcare utilization pattern may provide more precise estimates of risk for adverse events (AE) or death. We sought to characterize healthcare utilization prior to surgery using machine learning for the purposes of risk prediction. Methods: Patients from MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database undergoing elective surgery from 2007\u20132012 with \u22651 comorbidity were included. All available healthcare claims occurring within six months prior to surgery were assessed. More than 300 predictors were defined by considering all combinations of conditions, encounter types, and timing along with sociodemographic factors. We used a supervised Naive Bayes algorithm to predict risk of AE or death within 90 days of surgery. We compared the model\u2019s performance to the Charlson\u2019s comorbidity index, a commonly used risk prediction tool. Results: Among 410,521 patients (mean age 52, 52 \u00b1 9.4, 56% female), 4.7% had an AE and 0.01% died. The Charlson\u2019s comorbidity index predicted 57% of AE\u2019s and 59% of deaths. The Naive Bayes algorithm predicted 79% of AE\u2019s and 78% of deaths. Claims for cancer, kidney disease, and peripheral vascular disease were the primary drivers of AE or death following surgery. Conclusions: The use of machine learning algorithms improves upon one commonly used risk estimator. Precisely quantifying the risk of an AE following surgery may better inform patient-centered decision-making and direct targeted quality improvement interventions while supporting activities of accountable care organizations that rely on accurate estimates of population risk.",

        "abstract": "The large availability of clinical natural language documents, such as clinical narratives or diagnoses, requires the definition of smart automatic systems for their processing and analysis, but the lack of annotated corpora in the biomedical domain, especially in languages different from English, makes it difficult to exploit the state-of-art machine-learning systems to extract information from such kinds of documents. For these reasons, healthcare professionals lose big opportunities that can arise from the analysis of this data. In this paper, we propose a methodology to reduce the manual efforts needed to annotate a biomedical named entity recognition (B-NER) corpus, exploiting both active learning and distant supervision, respectively based on deep learning models (e.g., Bi-LSTM, word2vec FastText, ELMo and BERT) and biomedical knowledge bases, in order to speed up the annotation task and limit class imbalance issues. We assessed this approach by creating an Italian-language electronic health record corpus annotated with biomedical domain entities in a small fraction of the time required for a fully manual annotation. The obtained corpus was used to train a B-NER deep neural network whose performances are comparable with the state of the art, with an F1-Score equal to 0.9661 and 0.8875 on two test sets.",

The project aims to develop a real-time predictive analytics model as a decision support tool for clinicians in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit who care for patients after cardiac surgery. The team is using a supervised, closed-loop, machine learning design to train the model. The initiative involves collecting static and dynamic preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables from a cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Maine Medical Center. These variables, including data on blood product transfusions and inotropic and vasoactive medications administered, are being transmitted from the electronic health record to a data warehouse. The model will predict the following adverse outcomes: acute kidney injury, renal failure, new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation, prolonged ventilation, reoperation, operative mortality, delirium, stroke, deep sternal wound infection, and extended hospital length of stay. Outcomes: The HEART team successfully established a data-collecting infrastructure. Data collection and validation are ongoing, with an emphasis on accuracy and completeness. Next Steps: The project will advance by developing a user-friendly, real-time interface, incorporating feedback from clinicians in the operating room and cardiothoracic intensive care unit to ensure practicality and acceptance of the technology. This interface will provide adverse outcome predictions in real time, support clinical decision-making, and become a regular part of patient care.",

        "abstract": "Adequate nurse staffing is crucial for quality healthcare, necessitating accurate predictions of patient arrival rates. These forecasts can be determined using supervised machine learning methods. Optimization of machine learning methods is largely about minimizing the prediction error. Existing models primarily utilize data such as historical patient visits, seasonal trends, holidays, and calendars. However, it is unclear what other features reduce the prediction error. Our systematic literature review identifies studies that use supervised machine learning to predict patient arrival numbers using nontemporal features, which are features not based on time or dates. We scrutinized 26 284 studies, eventually focusing on 27 relevant ones. These studies highlight three main feature groups: weather data, internet search and usage data, and data on (social) interaction of groups. Internet data and social interaction data appear particularly promising, with some studies reporting reduced errors by up to 33%. Although weather data are frequently used, its utility is less clear. Other potential data sources, including smartphone and social media data, remain largely unexplored. One reason for this might be potential data privacy challenges. In summary, although patient arrival prediction has become more important in recent years, there are still many questions and opportunities for future research on the features used in this area.",

        "abstract": "\n\n\n\nThe new era of translational medicine is facing a special and unique transition as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) advance. The latest findings in many laboratories around the globes are promising and paved the way toward extraordinary innovative development in the field of medicine and medical research.\nIn medical research, gradual and consistent advancement, from rudimentary origins, were initial key steps toward medical discoveries and innovation. However, with the AI inclusion into these research approaches, the traditional translational medicine is pacing up. Creating a great hope for filling many sophisticated gaps in knowledge that has been a challenge by the traditional methodology. Such advancements in AI and its involvement in biomedicine and healthcare are forging the framework for a flourishing and visionary translational medicine and biomedical research.\nLately, following the discoveries made by a collaborative team of scientists from the University of Vermont and Tufts University (The xenobots), enormous research and investigation started to glance in the field. Attempts toward drug discovery, wound recoveries and self-proliferating stem cells were made. Most recently, scientists at Tufts University and Harvard University\u2019s Wyss Institute have designed and created living small robots from cells of human trachea. In an in vitro world, these created cells could induce tissue damage recovery.\nThe AI based medical diagnosis is also a revolutionary step toward proper diagnosis and consequently, medical intervention. The AI and ML are becoming so intelligent to an extent not to only diagnose the disease but also predict disease prognosis in future. The narrow AI (WatsonX) that was introduced by the IBM company can play a major role in assisting clinical decisions and image analysis. The challenge that faced the globe after the COVID-19 outbreak with multiple false negativity and false positivity outcomes in the diagnose necessitated the support of the AI in this field.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Neuralink that is introduced by Neuralink Corp. is taking a historical step after gaining the approval from FDA to start human trials. Such dramatical change in the brain interface using AI can be a solution for many diseases that human couldn\u2019t treat. Restoring brain activity and autonomy through integration of an AI to human nervous system is a mind-boggling promise that AI can give to medicine and medical science.\nFinally, these new approaches and advancement in AI and ML are prone to proper design and supervision, as well as, performing randomized clinical trials prior to the use in real-life medical interventions. Nonetheless, research and experimentations for AI inclusion in medicine are still an ongoing process, yet the opportunities are realistic that AI can be of great benefit in supporting medicine and biomedical research, specifically, where there is gap in knowledge and inability of human capacity to resolve them. There is no doubt that AI will be a significant party of the healthcare system in the future and a core medical support.",

We created a feature selection pipeline to identify critical features between different datasets. Then a variety of unsupervised and supervised methods were used (eg, Sammon mapping and eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to train models on datasets of differing data quality, which reflects the varying availability and potential rarity of ground truth data in medical databases.\n\n\nResults\nResulting machine learning model accuracies ranged from 47.7% to 94.4% when tested on ground truth data. Finally, we found new features to help experts enhance existing case-finding algorithms.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDeveloping precise algorithms to detect medical outcomes in claims can be a laborious and expensive process, particularly for conditions presented and coded diversely. We found it beneficial to filter out highly potent codes used for data curation to identify underlying patterns and features. To improve rule-based algorithms where necessary, researchers could use model explainers to determine noteworthy features, which could then be shared with experts and included in the algorithm.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur work suggests machine learning models can perform at similar levels as a previously published expert case-finding algorithm, while also having the potential to improve performance or streamline algorithm construction processes by identifying new relevant features for algorithm construction.",

        "abstract": "The United States healthcare system produces an enormous volume of data with a vast number of financial transactions generated by physicians administering healthcare services. This makes healthcare fraud difficult to detect, especially when there are considerably less fraudulent transactions (documented and readily available) than non-fraudulent. The ability to successfully detect fraudulent activities in healthcare, given such discrepancies, can garner up to $350 billion in recovered monetary losses. In machine learning, when one class has a substantially larger number of instances (majority) compared to the other (minority), this is known as class imbalance. In this paper, we focus specifically on Medicare, utilizing three \u2018Big Data\u2019 Medicare claims datasets with real-world fraudulent physicians. We create a training and test dataset for all three Medicare parts, both separately and combined, to assess fraud detection performance. To emulate class rarity, which indicates particularly severe levels of class imbalance, we generate additional datasets, by removing fraud instances, to determine the effects of rarity on fraud detection performance. Before a machine learning model can be distributed for real-world use, a performance evaluation is necessary to determine the best configuration (e.g. learner, class sampling ratio) and whether the associated error rates are low, indicating good detection rates. With our research, we demonstrate the effects of severe class imbalance and rarity using a training and testing (Train_Test) evaluation method via a hold-out set, and provide our recommendations based on the supervised machine learning results. Additionally, we repeat the same experiments using Cross-Validation, and determine it is a viable substitute for Medicare fraud detection. For machine learning with the severe class imbalance datasets, we found that, as expected, fraud detection performance decreased as the fraudulent instances became more rare. We apply Random Undersampling to both Train_Test and Cross-Validation, for all original and generated datasets, in order to assess potential improvements in fraud detection by reducing the adverse effects of class imbalance and rarity. Overall, our results indicate that the Train_Test method significantly outperforms Cross-Validation.",

Embedded within WiFi devices, the present radio subsystems can output CSI that describes the response of a wireless communication channel. Radio subsystems as such, use complex hardware architectures that consume lots of energy during data transmission, as well as exhibit phase drift in the sub-carriers. Although human motion recognition (HMR) based on multicarrier transmission systems show better classification accuracy, transmission of multiple sub-carriers results in an increase in the overall energy consumption at the transmitter. Apparently CSI based systems can be perceived as process intensive and power hungry devices. To alleviate the process intensive computing and reduce energy consumption in WiFi, this study proposes a human recognition system that uses only one radio carrier frequency. The study uses two software defined radios and a machine learning classifier to identify four humans, and the study results show that human identification is possible with 99% accuracy using only one radio carrier. The results of this study will have an impact on the development process of smart sensing systems, particularly those that relate to healthcare, authentication, and passive monitoring and sensing.

        "abstract": "Supervised machine learning algorithms deployed in acute healthcare settings use data describing historical episodes to predict clinical outcomes. Clinical settings are dynamic environments and the underlying data distributions characterising episodes can change with time (a phenomenon known as data drift), and so can the relationship between episode characteristics and associated clinical outcomes (so-called, concept drift). We demonstrate how explainable machine learning can be used to monitor data drift in a predictive model deployed within a hospital emergency department. We use the COVID-19 pandemic as an exemplar cause of data drift, which has brought a severe change in operational circumstances. We present a machine learning classifier trained using (pre-COVID-19) data, to identify patients at high risk of admission to hospital during an emergency department attendance. We evaluate our model's performance on attendances occurring pre-pandemic (AUROC 0.856 95%CI [0.852, 0.859]) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (AUROC 0.826 95%CI [0.814, 0.837]). We demonstrate two benefits of explainable machine learning (SHAP) for models deployed in healthcare settings: (1) By tracking the variation in a feature's SHAP value relative to its global importance, a complimentary measure of data drift is found which highlights the need to retrain a predictive model. (2) By observing the relative changes in feature importance emergent health risks can be identified.",

J Med Artif Intell 2021;4:6 | https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/jmai-21-12 Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia that can cause adverse events such as stroke, is a major clinical challenge. Due to its often asymptomatic and paroxysmal nature, AF is easily missed on single electrocardiograms (ECGs), making outpatient screening challenging. As a result, patients may not receive a timely diagnosis, with up to 5% of all AF cases being diagnosed at the time of stroke (1). Various machine learning (ML) models, primarily involving supervised ML methods, have been developed with the hopes of bringing an effective population screening tool to the forefront. While these models show strong performance in their respective studies, data regarding their effectiveness across racial groups is lacking. Therefore, using ML for AF screening requires two important considerations: (I) any biases in the training set data will be perpetuated in the predictions that the models offer; (II) AF has a known racial paradox, where traditional risk factors that were derived from a largely Caucasian population have a weaker correlation with AF incidence in Black patients. Below, we elaborate on these points and argue that while ML presents a unique opportunity to increase the detection of AF, it also deserves special caution to avoid reinforcing existing healthcare disparities. ML AF screening tools are commonly developed using ECG data about p-waves, R-R intervals, heart rate, and other parameters. While this has shown the ability to produce strong predictive models, the actual data sources deserve scrutiny (2). A recently published systematic review identified that while more than 100 publications exist using ECG data to develop ML models, more than half of them used the same four open-access ECG databases (3). In theory, this is not necessarily problematic, and it is understandable that so many studies reuse well known and freely available datasets. Ideally, however, the datasets would report a sufficient level of patient diversity to well represent the entire US population. Instead, many of the most commonly used ECG datasets only report limited demographic data, including the patient\u2019s age, gender, and/or baseline clinical characteristics, without reporting racial or ethnic background. Considering the known racial differences that exist in several baseline ECG parameters, including left ventricular hypertrophy, right axis deviation, bundle branch blocks, and others, transparency about racial demographic information in these datasets is critical (4). Table 1 summarizes the most commonly used ECG databases, as well as the readily available demographic information provided by each. The reuse of these datasets carries particular concern in the diagnosis of AF, a disease with a known \u201cracial paradox\u201d. This paradox refers to the fact that while Black patients have a higher burden of AF risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and others, they paradoxically have a lower incidence of AF (5). Many explanations for this paradox have been proposed, including underdiagnosis of AF in Black patients due to lower healthcare access, regional genetic variations, or an unequal influence of certain risk factors between racial groups (6-8). In either case, the presence of this paradox makes data transparency in AF an even greater priority. In the same way that traditional risk factors for AF showed worse correlations with incidence in Black patients, we may now be developing ML models with the same shortcomings. One solution is for hospital systems to develop AF models using their own internal databases. The Mayo Letter to the Editor",

        "abstract": "Here, we provide a new methodology for reducing false results and time delay of biosensors, which are barriers to industrial, healthcare, military, and consumer applications. We show that integrating machine learning with domain knowledge in biosensing can complement and improve the biosensor accuracy and speed relative to the performance achieved by traditional regression analysis of a standard curve based on the biosensor steady-state response. The methodology was validated by rapid and accurate quantification of microRNA across the nanomolar to femtomolar range using the dynamic response of cantilever biosensors. Theory-guided feature engineering improved the performance and efficiency of several classification models relative to the performance achieved using traditional feature engineering methods (TSFRESH). In addition to the entire dynamic response, the technique enabled rapid and accurate quantification of the target analyte concentration and false-positive and false-negative results using the initial transient response, thereby reducing the required data acquisition time (i.e., time delay). We show that model explainability can be achieved by combining theory-guided feature engineering and feature importance analysis. The performance of multiple classifiers using both TSFRESH- and theory-based features from the biosensor\u2019s initial transient response was similar to that achieved using the entire dynamic response with data augmentation. We also show that the methodology can guide design of experiments for high-performance biosensing applications, specifically, the selection of data acquisition parameters (e.g., time) based on potential application-dependent performance thresholds. This work provides an example of the opportunities for improving biosensor performance, such as reducing biosensor false results and time delay, using explainable machine learning models supervised by domain knowledge in biosensing.",

        "title": "Revolutionizing Drug Discovery: Harnessing Machine Learning Algorithms",
        "abstract": "Drug discovery is a crucial element of biomedical research, with the goal of finding and creating new medical treatments for a variety of illnesses. Yet, the conventional process of finding new drugs is frequently impeded by its intrinsic difficulties, such as expensive expenses, long durations, and poor success rates in trials with patients. Recently, the incorporation of machine learning (ML) algorithms has become a revolutionary method to streamline and improve different phases of drug discovery. This summary offers a glimpse into the rapidly growing area of drug discovery using machine learning algorithms, emphasizing its potential to transform the process of developing treatments.\nThe usual process of discovering drugs involves various stages such as identifying the target, finding lead compounds, conducting preclinical tests, undergoing clinical trials, and obtaining regulatory approval. All these phases require a lot of labor, time, and resources, leading to high attrition rates and limited success in turning potential compounds into approved therapies. Nevertheless, researchers can enhance and speed up crucial parts of the drug discovery process by using ML algorithms.\nML algorithms use data to aid in drug discovery by utilizing computational models to examine large quantities of biological, chemical, and clinical data. These algorithms can learn from various types of data, such as genomic data, chemical structures, protein interactions, and clinical outcomes, to discover hidden patterns, find new targets for drugs, and forecast the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. Moreover, machine learning algorithms allow for the investigation of intricate connections between molecular structures and biological effects, making it easier to create improved drug candidates with better effectiveness and specificity.\nImportant uses of machine learning in pharmaceutical research involve finding and confirming targets, screening compounds and improving leads, repurposing drugs, and tailoring treatments for individuals. Commonly used for classification and regression tasks, supervised learning algorithms like support vector machines and random forests predict compound activity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties. Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques utilized in unsupervised learning algorithms help analyze vast datasets and discover new drug-target interactions. Advanced abilities for analyzing molecular structures, virtual screening, and designing new drugs are provided by deep learning models like convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.\nMultiple case studies demonstrate how ML algorithms can significantly impact drug discovery. Collaboration among academia, industry, and research institutions has resulted in the creation of new ML-based methods for drug development, identifying targets, and categorizing patients. Nevertheless, there are challenges accompanying the widespread use of ML in drug discovery. In healthcare, it is crucial to address ethical considerations, regulatory hurdles, and data privacy concerns to ensure the responsible and ethical use of ML algorithms.\nThe potential for transforming drug discovery and therapeutic development is immense with the incorporation of machine learning algorithms. Through utilizing data-driven methods, researchers can speed up the discovery of new potential drugs, enhance the effectiveness of treatments, and ultimately enhance the results for patients.

These technologies, based on machine learning and deep learning, enable the identification of risks, the proposal of personalized interventions, and the monitoring of patient progress using data extracted from clinical records. ChatGPT excels in areas such as nutritional assessment by calculating caloric needs and suggesting nutrient-rich foods, and in diagnosis, by identifying nutritional issues with technical terminology. In interventions, it offers dietary and educational strategies but lacks critical abilities such as interpreting non-verbal cues or performing physical examinations. Recent studies indicate that ChatGPT achieves high accuracy in questions related to clinical guidelines but shows deficiencies in integrating multiple medical conditions or ensuring the accuracy of meal plans. Additionally, generated plans may exhibit significant caloric deviations and imbalances in micronutrients such as vitamin D and B12. Despite its limitations, this AI has the potential to complement clinical practice by improving accessibility and personalization in nutritional care. However, its effective implementation requires professional supervision, integration with existing healthcare systems, and constant updates to its databases.

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a type of developmental disorder that can have notable effects on a person\u2019s cognitive abilities, language skills, ability to recognize objects, social interactions, and communication skills. The primary etiology of this condition is attributed to genetics, and prompt detection and intervention may mitigate the potential for the individual to face exorbitant healthcare expenses and protracted diagnostic procedures. A machine learning (ML) and deep learning architecture was developed with the capability to effectively analyze datasets of autistic toddlers, accurately classifying and identifying ASD traits. To explore the feasibility of predicting and analyzing ASD characteristics across various age cohorts, we employed multiple supervised ML models, namely support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors algorithm, and decision tree, and deep learning models, such as long short-term memory (LSTM). In this study, we analyzed the ASD screening dataset of toddlers from Saudi Arabia. The ASD screening datasets of toddlers from Kaggle were used to test these models. The first dataset includes 1054 instances and 19 toddler-related features, while the remaining datasets consist of 16 features, 507 instances, 165 normal, and 141 ASD cases. We report baseline results of behavior classification using ML and DL approaches. The SVM approach achieved 100% accuracy, whereas the LSTM approach attained 100% accuracy in terms of the accuracy metric. The developed system demonstrates the efficacy of the ASD system in detecting ASD toddlers in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the ASD system has the potential to assist parents in examining their children at an early stage.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nUtilize machine learning models to identify factors associated with seeking medical care for migraine.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nMigraine is a leading cause of disability worldwide, yet many people with migraine do not seek medical care.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe web-based survey, ObserVational survey of the Epidemiology, tReatment and Care Of MigrainE (US), annually recruited demographically representative samples of the US adult population (2018-2020). Respondents with active migraine were identified via a validated diagnostic questionnaire and/or a self-reported medical diagnosis of migraine, and were then asked if they had consulted a healthcare professional for their headaches in the previous 12\u2009months (i.e., \"seeking care\"). This included in-person/telephone/or e-visit at Primary Care, Specialty Care, or Emergency/Urgent Care locations. Supervised machine learning (Random Forest) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithms identified 13/54 sociodemographic and clinical factors most associated with seeking medical care for migraine. Random Forest models complex relationships (including interactions) between predictor variables and a response. LASSO is also an efficient feature selection algorithm. Linear models were used to determine the multivariable association of those factors with seeking care.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 61,826 persons with migraine, the mean age was 41.7\u2009years (\u00b114.8) and 31,529/61,826 (51.0%) sought medical care for migraine in the previous 12\u2009months. Of those seeking care for migraine, 23,106/31,529 (73.3%) were female, 21,320/31,529 (67.6%) were White, and 28,030/31,529 (88.9%) had health insurance. Severe interictal burden (assessed via the Migraine Interictal Burden Scale-4, MIBS-4) occurred in 52.8% (16,657/31,529) of those seeking care and in 23.1% (6991/30,297) of those not seeking care; similar patterns were observed for severe migraine-related disability (assessed via the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale, MIDAS) (36.7% [11,561/31,529] vs. 14.6% [4434/30,297]) and severe ictal cutaneous allodynia (assessed via the Allodynia Symptom Checklist, ASC-12) (21.0% [6614/31,529] vs. 7.4% [2230/30,297]). Severe interictal burden (vs. none, OR 2.64, 95% CI [2.5, 2.8]); severe migraine-related disability (vs. little/none, OR 2.2, 95% CI [2.0, 2.3]); and severe ictal allodynia (vs. none, OR 1.7, 95% CI [1.6, 1.8]) were strongly associated with seeking care for migraine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSeeking medical care for migraine is associated with higher interictal burden, disability, and allodynia. These findings could support interventions to promote care-seeking among people with migraine, encourage assessment of these factors during consultation, and prioritize these domains in selecting treatments and measuring their benefits.",

        "abstract": "Background Infectious diseases not only cause severe health problems but also burden the healthcare system. Therefore, the effective treatment of those diseases is crucial. Both conventional approaches, such as antimicrobial agents, and novel approaches, like antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), are used to treat infections. However, due to the drawbacks of current approaches, new solutions are still being investigated. One recent approach is the use of AMPs and antimicrobial agents in combination, but determining synergism is with a huge variety of AMPs time-consuming and requires multiple experimental studies. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely used to predict biological outcomes, particularly in the field of AMPs, but no previous research reported on predicting the synergistic effects of AMPs and antimicrobial agents. Results Several supervised ML models were implemented to accurately predict the synergistic effect of AMPs and antimicrobial agents. The results demonstrated that the hyperparameter-optimized Light Gradient Boosted Machine Classifier (oLGBMC) yielded the best test accuracy of 76.92% for predicting the synergistic effect. Besides, the feature importance analysis reveals that the target microbial species, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the AMP and the antimicrobial agents, and the used antimicrobial agent were the most important features for the prediction of synergistic effect, which aligns with recent experimental studies in the literature. Conclusion This study reveals that ML algorithms can predict the synergistic activity of two different antimicrobial agents without the need for complex and time-consuming experimental procedures. The implications support that the ML models may not only reduce the experimental cost but also provide validation of experimental procedures.

This study introduces an innovative Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for early detection, leveraging the strengths of both fuzzy logic and machine learning. By analyzing patient-specific data such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, galvanic skin response, and body temperature, our system utilizes fuzzy logic to evaluate potential disease symptoms, enabling self-diagnosis under medical supervision. This personalized approach enables individuals to monitor their health and seek prompt medical attention as needed.

        "title": "Comparing Sampling Strategies for Tackling Imbalanced Data in Human Activity Recognition",
        "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is an increasingly active research topic in machine learning, aided in part by the ready availability of detailed motion capture data from smartphones, fitness trackers, and smartwatches. The goal of HAR is to use such devices to assist users in their daily lives in application areas such as healthcare, physical therapy, and fitness. One of the main challenges for HAR, particularly when using supervised learning methods, is obtaining balanced data for algorithm optimisation and testing. As people perform some activities more than others (e.g., walk more than run), HAR datasets are typically imbalanced. The lack of dataset representation from minority classes hinders the ability of HAR classifiers to sufficiently capture new instances of those activities. We introduce three novel hybrid sampling strategies to generate more diverse synthetic samples to overcome the class imbalance problem. The first strategy, which we call the distance-based method (DBM), combines Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques (SMOTE) with Random_SMOTE, both of which are built around the k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The second technique, referred to as the noise detection-based method (NDBM), combines SMOTE Tomek links (SMOTE_Tomeklinks) and the modified synthetic minority oversampling technique (MSMOTE). The third approach, which we call the cluster-based method (CBM), combines Cluster-Based Synthetic Oversampling (CBSO) and Proximity Weighted Synthetic Oversampling Technique (ProWSyn). We compare the performance of the proposed hybrid methods to the individual constituent methods and baseline using accelerometer data from three commonly used benchmark datasets. We show that DBM, NDBM, and CBM reduce the impact of class imbalance and enhance F1 scores by a range of 9\u201320 percentage point compared to their constituent sampling methods. CBM performs significantly better than the others under a Friedman test, however, DBM has lower computational requirements.",

        "abstract": "Background As the ageing population continues to grow in many countries, the prevalence of geriatric diseases is on the rise. In response, healthcare providers are exploring novel methods to enhance the quality of life for the elderly. Over the last decade, there has been a remarkable surge in the use of machine learning in geriatric diseases and care. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of these conditions. Hence, our study aims to find out the present state of research in geriatrics and the application of machine learning methods in this area. Methods This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and focused on healthy ageing in individuals aged 45 and above, with a specific emphasis on the diseases that commonly occur during this process. The study mainly focused on three areas, that are machine learning, the geriatric population, and diseases. Peer-reviewed articles were searched in the PubMed and Scopus databases with inclusion criteria of population above 45\u00a0years, must have used machine learning methods, and availability of full text. To assess the quality of the studies, Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) critical appraisal tool was used. Results A total of 70 papers were selected from the 120 identified papers after going through title screening, abstract screening, and reference search. Limited research is available on predicting biological or brain age using deep learning and different supervised machine learning methods. Neurodegenerative disorders were found to be the most researched disease, in which Alzheimer\u2019s disease was focused the most. Among non-communicable diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, kidney diseases, and cardiovascular diseases were included, and other rare diseases like oral health-related diseases and bone diseases were also explored in some papers. In terms of the application of machine learning, risk prediction was the most common approach. Half of the studies have used supervised machine learning algorithms, among which logistic regression, random forest, XG Boost were frequently used methods. These machine learning methods were applied to a variety of datasets including population-based surveys, hospital records, and digitally traced data. Conclusion The review identified a wide range of studies that employed machine learning algorithms to analyse various diseases and datasets. While the application of machine learning in geriatrics and care has been well-explored, there is still room for future development, particularly in validating models across diverse populations and utilizing personalized digital datasets for customized patient-centric care in older populations. Further, we suggest a scope of Machine Learning in generating comparable ageing indices such as successful ageing index.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks must address the dual challenge of delivering high-accuracy predictions and providing user-friendly explanations. While deep models are widely used in the field of time series modeling, deciphering the core principles that govern the models\u2019 outputs remains a significant challenge. This is crucial for fostering the development of trusted models and facilitating domain expert validation, thereby empowering users and domain experts to utilize them confidently in high-risk decision-making contexts (e.g., decision-support systems in healthcare). In this work, we put forward a deep prototype learning model that supports interpretable and manipulable modeling and classification of medical time series (i.e., ECG signal). Specifically, we first optimize the representation of single heartbeat data by employing a bidirectional long short-term memory and attention mechanism, and then construct prototypes during the training phase. The final classification outcomes (i.e., normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and other rhythm) are determined by comparing the input with the obtained prototypes. Moreover, the proposed model presents a human\u2013machine collaboration mechanism, allowing domain experts to refine the prototypes by integrating their expertise to further enhance the model\u2019s performance (contrary to the human-in-the-loop paradigm, where humans primarily act as supervisors or correctors, intervening when required, our approach focuses on a human\u2013machine collaboration, wherein both parties engage as partners, enabling more fluid and integrated interactions). The experimental outcomes presented herein delineate that, within the realm of binary classification tasks\u2014specifically distinguishing between normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation\u2014our proposed model, albeit registering marginally lower performance in comparison to certain established baseline models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory with attention mechanisms (Bi-LSTMAttns), evidently surpasses other contemporary state-of-the-art prototype baseline models. Moreover, it demonstrates significantly enhanced performance relative to these prototype baseline models in the context of triple classification tasks, which encompass normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and other rhythm classifications. The proposed model manifests a commendable prediction accuracy of 0.8414, coupled with macro precision, recall, and F1-score metrics of 0.8449, 0.8224, and 0.8235, respectively, achieving both high classification accuracy as well as good interpretability.",

In the cloud environment, big data is abundant, necessitating proper classification that can be effectively divided using machine language. Machine learning is used to investigate algorithms for learning and data prediction. The Cleveland database is frequently used by machine learning researchers. Among the performance metrics used to compare the proposed and existing methodologies are execution time, defect detection rate, and accuracy. In this study, two supervised learning-based classifiers, SVM and Novel KNN, were proposed and used to analyses data from a benchmark database obtained from the UCI repository. Initially, intrusions were detected using the SVM classification method. The proposed study demonstrated how the novel KNN used for distance capacity outperformed previous studies. The accuracy of the results of both approaches is evaluated. The results show that the intrusion detection system (IDS) with a 98.98% accuracy rate produces the best results when using the suggested system.",

        "abstract": "Medical organizations struggle to deal with huge high-dimensional datasets that need powerful machine learning systems to produce precise healthcare outcomes. Traditional analytical techniques prove inadequate when dealing with extraction from features and performance of classifiers in this specific setting. The research introduces an algorithm which enhances Stacked Autoencoders (SAEs) by combining them with a customized Logistic Regression model intended for medical high-dimensional data analysis. This approach implements a Hybrid Imputation Method using MICE and KNN Imputation which precedes other stages and helps process missing values and outliers in medical data. We use CNNs and SAEs together for deep feature extraction before using Feature Fusion to assemble a robust feature collection. A set of the most important features is identified by executing Advanced Ensemble Feature Selection (EFS) procedures which include Few-shot Learning and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning Algorithm (MAML) and Genetic Algorithm-Based Feature Selection (GAFS). The procedure of fine-tuning pre-trained models represents an effective enhancement for classification tasks particularly in situations of limited dataset availability. The experimental outcomes demonstrate remarkable performance gains in terms of accuracy and sensitivity and specificity as well as reduced execution time as compared to current techniques. Upcoming work for this study involves speeding up algorithm processing abilities and scalability alongside the integration of robust deep learning structures with self-supervised learning methodologies together with upgrade transfer learning approaches for medical dataset variety applications. The study will concentrate on enhancing model transparency through explainable AI and real-time validation for clinical deployment and ethical and regulatory compliance to develop this technique for practical healthcare settings.",

Beside its general use in terms of autonomous cars and smart homes, but some of the best applications of IoT technology in fields of health care monitoring is worth mentioning. The main purpose of this research work is to provide comport services for patients. It can be used to promote basic nursing care by improving the quality of care and patient safety from patient home environment. Rural area of a country lacks behind the proper patient monitoring system. So, remote monitoring and prescribing by sharing medical information in an authenticated manner is very effective for betterment of medical facilities in rural area. We have proposed a healthcare system which can analyze ECG report using supervise machine learning techniques. Analyzing report can be stored in cloud platform which can be further used to prescribe by the experienced medical practitioner. For performance evaluation, ECG data is analyzed using six supervised machine learning algorithms. Data sets are divided into two groups: 75 percent data for training the model and rest 25 percent data for testing. To avoid any kind of anomalies or repetitions, cross validation and random train-test split was used to obtain the result as accurate as possible.",

        "abstract": "Emergency care is one of the cornerstone parts of the world health organization's action plan. Rapid response and immediate care are considered in agile emergency care. Artificial intelligence (AI) and informatics have been applied to fulfill these requirements through automated emergency technology. Machine learning (ML) is one of the main parts of some of these proposed technologies. There are various ML algorithms and techniques which are potentially applicable for different purposes of emergency care. AI-based approaches using classification and clustering algorithms, natural language processing, and text mining are some of the possible techniques that could prove useful for investigating models of emergency prevention and management and proposing improved procedures for handling such critical situations. ML is known as a field of AI which attempts to automatically learn from data and applies that learning to make better decisions. Decision-support tools can apply the results of either supervised or various semi-supervised or unsupervised learning methods to tackle the how decisions about emergency situations are typically handled by the best professionals at the scene of an emergency, in the pre-hospital, and in healthcare facility settings. Enhanced and rapid communication at the moment of emergency, with the most effective decision making for triaging to estimate the acute nature of injuries and possible complications, how to keep a patient stable on the way to the care facility, and also avoiding adverse drug reactions, are some of the possible directions for exploring how ML can help to gather the data and to make emergency management more efficient and effective. The wide range of scenarios present in emergency situations and the complexity of different legal and ethical constraints on what responding personnel are allowed to perform on an injured subject before reaching a hospital makes for a most challenging set of problems for investigating the components of \"intelligent\" decision support that could help in these highly interactive and humanly tragic situations.",

One of these medical applications is the early prediction system for heart diseases especially; coronary artery disease (CAD) also called atherosclerosis. The need for a medical diagnosis support system is to detect atherosclerosis at the earlier stages to optimize the diagnosis, avoid the advanced cases, and reduce treatment costs. Earlier, the datasets are collected from specific medical sources and have evaluated against computer applications. In this paper, a supervised machine learning medical diagnosis support system (MDSS) for atherosclerosis prediction is presented that able to obtain and learn automatically knowledge from each patient's clinical data. Therefore, we used three Machine Learning (ML) classifiers for the proposed MDSS for atherosclerosis. Thus, this work is accomplished using databases collected from the UCI repository (Cleveland, Hungarian) and Sani Z-Alizadeh dataset. The performance metrics were computed utilizing Accuracy, Recall and Precision. Furthermore, F1-score and Matthews\u2019s correlation coefficient these measures were also calculated to greatly increase the proposed system performance. Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation methods have been used for proposed model performance evaluation that achieved 94% as the best accuracy average. Consequently, the proposed model can be used to support healthcare and facilitate largescale clinical diagnostic of atherosclerosis diseases.",

Methods We recruited 1151 participants with an average age of 74.8 years by convenience sampling from a primary healthcare setting to carry out the cross-sectional study over 6 months. The whole dataset was divided into two sets, namely training set and test set, which respectively occupied 70% and 30% of the whole dataset. The training dataset was used first; decision tree analysis was used to identify possible stratifying variables that could help to generate separate decision models. Results The number of fallers was 230 with 20% 1-year prevalence. There were significant differences in gender, use of walking aids, presence of chronic diseases, and co-morbidities including osteoporosis, depression, and previous upper limb fractures, and performance in the Timed Up and Go test and the Functional Reach test among the baselines between the faller and non-faller groups. Three decision tree models for the dependent dichotomous variables (fallers, indoor fallers, and outdoor fallers) were generated, with overall accuracy rates of the models of 77.40%, 89.44% and 85.76%, respectively. Timed Up and Go, Functional Reach, body mass index, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and number of drugs taken were identified as stratifying variables in the decision tree models for fall screening. Conclusion The use of decision tree analysis for clinical algorithms for accidental falls in community-dwelling older people creates patterns for decision-making in fall screening, which also paves the way for utility-based decision-making using supervised machine learning in fall risk detection.",

        "abstract": "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 195 million people have been infected and 4.2 million have died from the disease or its side effects. Physicians, healthcare scientists and medical staff continuously try to deal with overloaded hospital admissions, while in parallel, they try to identify meaningful correlations between the severity of infected patients with their symptoms, comorbidities and biomarkers. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been used recently in many areas related to COVID-19 healthcare. The main goal is to manage effectively the wide variety of issues related to COVID-19 and its consequences. The existing applications of ML to COVID-19 healthcare are based on supervised classifications which require a labeled training dataset, serving as reference point for learning, as well as predefined classes. However, the existing knowledge about COVID-19 and its consequences is still not solid and the points of common agreement among different scientific communities are still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to follow an unsupervised clustering approach, where prior knowledge is not required (tabula rasa). More specifically, 268 hospitalized patients at the First Propaedeutic Department of Internal Medicine of AHEPA University Hospital of Thessaloniki were assessed in terms of 40 clinical variables (numerical and categorical), leading to a high-dimensionality dataset. Dimensionality reduction was performed by applying a principal component analysis (PCA) on the numerical part of the dataset and a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) on the categorical part of the dataset. Then, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was applied to Gaussian mixture models (GMM) in order to identify the optimal number of clusters under which the best grouping of patients occurs. The proposed methodology identified four clusters of patients with similar clinical characteristics. The analysis revealed a cluster of asymptomatic patients that resulted in death at a rate of 23.8%. This striking result forces us to reconsider the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 clinical symptoms and the patient\u2019s mortality.",

        "abstract": "An increasing and aging patient population poses a growing burden on healthcare professionals. Automation of medical imaging diagnostics holds promise for enhancing patient care and reducing manpower required to accommodate an increasing patient-population. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has the potential to facilitate automated diagnostics, but commonly requires large-scaled labeled datasets. In medical domains, data is often abundant but labeling is a laborious and costly task. Active learning provides a method to optimize the selection of unlabeled samples that are most suitable for improvement of the model and incorporate them into the model training process. This approach proves beneficial when only a small number of labeled samples are available. Various selection methods currently exist, but most of them employ fixed querying schedules. There is limited research on how the timing of a query can impact performance in relation to the number of queried samples. This paper proposes a novel approach called dynamic querying, which aims to optimize the timing of queries to enhance model development while utilizing as few labeled images as possible. The performance of the proposed model is compared to a model trained utilizing a fully-supervised training method, and its effectiveness is assessed based on dataset size requirements and loss rates. Dynamic querying demonstrates a considerably faster learning curve in relation to the number of labeled samples used, achieving an accuracy of 70% using only 24 samples, compared to 82% for a fully-supervised model trained on the complete training dataset of 1017 images.",

Twitter stands out as one of the most popular online social media platforms due to its easy, unique, and advanced accessibility using the API. On the other hand, supervised learning is the most widely used paradigm for tasks involving sentiment polarity and fine-grained emotion detection in short and informal texts, such as Twitter posts. However, supervised learning models are data-hungry and heavily reliant on abundant labeled data, which remains a challenge. This study aims to address this challenge by creating a large-scale real-world dataset of 17.5 million tweets. A distant supervision approach relying on emojis available in tweets is applied to label tweets corresponding to Ekman\u2019s six basic emotions. Additionally, we conducted a series of experiments using various conventional machine learning models and deep learning, including transformer-based models, on our dataset to establish baseline results. The experimental results and an extensive ablation analysis on the dataset showed that BiLSTM with FastText and an attention mechanism outperforms other models in both classification tasks, achieving an F1-score of 70.92% for sentiment classification and 54.85% for emotion detection.",

However, the development of healthcare-related algorithms that are both personalized and robust requires the collection of large volumes of data to capture representative instances of all possible states. While the rise of flexible biosignal acquisition solutions has enabled the expedition of data collection, they often require complicated frameworks or do not provide the customization required in some research contexts. As such, EpiBOX was developed as an open-source, standalone, and automated platform that enables the long-term acquisition of biosignals, passable to be operated by individuals with low technological proficiency. In particular, in this paper, we present an in-depth explanation of the framework, methods for the evaluation of its performance, and the corresponding findings regarding the perspective of the end-user. The impact of the network connection on data transfer latency was studied, demonstrating innocuous latency values for reasonable signal strengths and manageable latency values even when the connection was unstable. Moreover, performance profiling of the EpiBOX user interface (mobile application) indicates a suitable performance in all aspects, providing an encouraging outlook on adherence to the system. Finally, the experience of our research group is described as a use case, indicating a promising outlook regarding the use of the EpiBOX framework within similar contexts. As a byproduct of these features, our hope is that by empowering physicians, technicians, and monitored subjects to supervise the biosignal collection process, we enable researchers to scale biosignal collection.",

        "abstract": ": One of the significant advances resulting from the ability to predict incidents is the emergence of predictive incident management as the critical capability for proactive monitoring and management of modern complex systems. This survey presents the complete picture of foretelling incident management based on machine learning techniques and the up - to - date advancement in this area. The primary issue is that the way incident management is done on emergency help is reactive and causes people to be delayed, services to be interrupted, and costs to go high. The manual gambling of computerized (hardware/software) failures is almost impossible in complex, highly dynamic systems with a large amount of monitoring data. Machine learning techniques are considered for implementing an automated disaster detection system that can be trained on observing data properties related to system features to forecast incidents before they occur. Applying models like regression and neural networks to supervised learning can help recognize imminent storm symptoms by referencing past antecedents. Another feature of unsupervised techniques such as clustering is that they can be used to identify anomalies witnessed, which gives the earliest indications that there could be emerging problems. Online education goes on to lead to the practicality of predictive software. This review studies the potential of predictive incident management applications in monitoring the IT system, industrial predictive maintenance, healthcare systems, fraud detection, and supply chain risk. The effect, therefore, is improved service quality and stability, diagnostics accuracy, and resource allocation optimization. The following steps are adding new data sources to predict further scenarios, distributed learning at scale, making AIs one step further explaining themselves, and preserving people's privacy while dealing with data. The preference for predictive incident management based on machine learning allows industry - wide organizations to go from reactive to proactive with machine - driven systems management throughout the economy .",

More accurate predictions of stroke outcomes can guide healthcare organizations in allocating appropriate resources to improve care and reduce both the economic and social burden of the disease. We aim to develop and evaluate the performance and explainability of three supervised machine learning models and the traditional multinomial logistic regression (mLR) in predicting functional dependence and death three months after stroke, using routinely-collected data. This prognostic study included adult patients, registered in the Swedish Stroke Registry (Riksstroke) from 2015 to 2020. Riksstroke contains information on stroke care and outcomes among patients treated in hospitals in Sweden. Prognostic factors (features) included demographic characteristics, pre-stroke functional status, cardiovascular risk factors, medications, acute care, stroke type, and severity. The outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale at three months after stroke (a scale of 0\u20132 indicates independent, 3\u20135 dependent, and 6 dead). Outcome prediction models included support vector machines, artificial neural networks (ANN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and mLR. The models were trained and evaluated on 75% and 25% of the dataset, respectively. Model predictions were explained using SHAP values. The study included 102,135 patients (85.8% ischemic stroke, 53.3% male, mean age 75.8 years, and median NIHSS of 3). All models demonstrated similar overall accuracy (69%\u201370%). The ANN and XGBoost models performed significantly better than the mLR in classifying dependence with F1-scores of 0.603 (95% CI; 0.594\u20130.611) and 0.577 (95% CI; 0.568\u20130.586), versus 0.544 (95% CI; 0.545\u20130.563) for the mLR model. The factors that contributed most to the predictions were expectedly similar in the models, based on clinical knowledge. Our ANN and XGBoost models showed a modest improvement in prediction performance and explainability compared to mLR using routinely-collected data. Their improved ability to predict functional dependence may be of particular importance for the planning and organization of acute stroke care and rehabilitation.",

        "abstract": "The supervised machine learning method is often used for biomedical relationship extraction. The disadvantage is that it requires much time and money to manually establish an annotated dataset. Based on distant supervision, the knowledge base is combined with the corpus, thus, the training corpus can be automatically annotated. As many biomedical databases provide knowledge bases for study with a limited number of annotated corpora, this method is practical in biomedicine. The clinical significance of each patient\u2019s genetic makeup can be understood based on the healthcare provider\u2019s genetic database. Unfortunately, the lack of previous biomedical relationship extraction studies focuses on gene\u2013gene interaction. The main purpose of this study is to develop extraction methods for gene\u2013gene interactions that can help explain the heritability of human complex diseases. This study referred to the information on gene\u2013gene interactions in the KEGG PATHWAY database, the abstracts in PubMed were adopted to generate the training sample set, and the graph kernel method was adopted to extract gene\u2013gene interactions. The best assessment result was an F1-score of 0.79. Our developed distant supervision method automatically finds sentences through the corpus without manual labeling for extracting gene\u2013gene interactions, which can effectively reduce the time cost for manual annotation data; moreover, the relationship extraction method based on a graph kernel can be successfully applied to extract gene\u2013gene interactions. In this way, the results of this study are expected to help achieve precision medicine.

        "title": "Predicting pregnancy loss and its determinants among reproductive-aged women using supervised machine learning algorithms in Sub-Saharan Africa",
        "abstract": "Background Pregnancy loss is a significant public health issue globally, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where maternal health outcomes continue to be a major concern. Despite notable progress in improving maternal health, pregnancy-related complications, including s due to miscarriages, stillbirths, and induced abortions, continue to impact women's health, social wellbeing, and economic stability in the region. This study aims to identify the key predictors of pregnancy loss and develop effective predictive models for pregnancy loss among reproductive-aged women in SSA. Methods We derived the data for this cross-sectional study from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey of Sub-Saharan African countries. Python software was used to process the data, and machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Gaussian were applied. The performance of the predictive models was evaluated using several standard metrics, including the ROC curve, accuracy score, precision, recall, and F-measure. Result The final experimental results indicated that the Random Forest model performed the best in predicting pregnancy loss, achieving an accuracy of 98%, precision of 98%, F-measure of 83%, ROC curve of 94%, and recall of 77%. The Gaussian model had the lowest classification accuracy, with an accuracy of 92.64% compared to the others. Based on SHPY values, unmarried women may be more likely to experience pregnancy loss, particularly in contexts where premarital pregnancies are stigmatized. The use of antenatal care and family planning services can significantly impact the risk of pregnancy loss. Women from lower-income backgrounds may face challenges in accessing prenatal care or safe reproductive health services, leading to higher risks of loss. Additionally, higher levels of education are often correlated with increased awareness of family planning methods and better access to healthcare, which can reduce the likelihood of unintended pregnancy loss. Conclusion The Random Forest machine learning model demonstrates greater predictive power in estimating pregnancy loss risk factors. Machine learning can help facilitate early prediction and intervention for women at high risk of pregnancy loss. Based on these findings, we recommend policy measures aimed at reducing pregnancy loss Sub-Saharan African countries.",

        "abstract": "Private stakeholders and governments across the globe are striving to improve the quality and access of healthcare services to citizens. The need to improve healthcare services, coupled with the increase in social awareness and improvement of people\u2019s living standards, has seen an increase in medical policyholders in the insurance industry. Even so, the healthcare sector is grappled with increased costs every other year, leading to revision of premiums and increased costs for the policyholders. One of the main factors contributing to the increased costs is fraudulent claims raised by the service providers and the policyholders, leading to unprecedented risks and losses for insurance firms. The insurance industry has set up fraud detection and mitigation systems to mitigate losses brought about by fraudulent claims, which come in two flavors: rule-based systems and expert claims analysis. With rule-based systems, conditions such as missing details, location of the claim vis a vis the location of the policyholder, among other rules, are evaluated by systems to assess the validity of the claims. On the other hand, insurance firms rely on the human intervention of experts using statistical analyses and artificial rules to detect fraudulent claims. The rule-based and expert analysis methods fail to detect patterns or anomalies in claims, which is central to efficient fraud detection. Data mining and machine learning techniques are being leveraged to detect fraud. This automation presents enormous opportunities for identifying hidden patterns for further analysis by insurance firms. This research aims to analyze a hybrid approach to detect medical insurance fraud using both K-Means (unsupervised) and Support Vector Machines (supervised) machine learning algorithms.",

Inspection methods are usually employed in HCI to assess usability of interactive systems. However, they do not consider the state of the operator while executing a task, the surrounding environment and the task demands. It is argued that assessing performance of operators is fundamental for designing optimal systems with which healthcare can be effectively delivered. The aim of our solution is to assess performance of operators employing the notion of Mental Workload (MWL) this being a construct believed to strongly correlate with performance. The proposal is to develop a model for MWL assessment using supervised machine learning. This model will be evaluated via user studies involving clinicians and operators interacting with a set of medical systems. Assessments of MWL will be compared and validated with objective indexes of performance such as error rate and task execution time.",

        "abstract": "Supervised machine learning techniques are commonly used in many areas like finance, education, healthcare, engineering, etc. because of their ability to learn from past data. However, such techniques can be very slow if the dataset is high-dimensional, and also irrelevant features may reduce classification success. Therefore, feature selection or feature reduction techniques are commonly used to overcome the mentioned issues. On the other hand, information security for both people and networks is crucial, and it must be secured without wasting the time. Hence, feature selection approaches that can make the algorithms faster without reducing the classification success are needed. In this study, we compare both the classification success and run-time performance of state-of-the-art classification algorithms using standard deviation-based feature selection in the aspect of security datasets. For this purpose, we applied standard deviation-based feature selection to KDD Cup 99 and Phishing Legitimate datasets for selecting the most relevant features, and then we run the selected classification algorithms on the datasets to compare the results. According to the obtained results, while the classification success of all algorithms is satisfying Decision Tree (DT) was the best one among others. On the other hand, while Decision Tree, k Nearest Neighbors, and Na\u00efve Bayes (BN) were sufficiently fast, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN or NN) were too slow.",

        "abstract": "The number of insurgents in our nation today is significantly rising each day, and the majority of those affected are living as Internally Displayed Persons (IDP) in various IDP camps. These people experience a variety of health problems as a result of numerous factors. Due to financial difficulties and a lack of accessibility to healthcare facilities and medical professionals, these health risk factors may occasionally go undetected for long periods. BMI excesses, such as those in the underweight, overweight, and obese categories, are linked to several health issues, including low birth weight, poor quality of life, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and higher mortality. In the context of this paper, identifying the health status of IDPs depends critically on human body weight. For people living in IDP camps, early detection of the weight categories like underweight, overweight, and obese people is crucial because if not, they will be an early death or other health complications. To reduce mortality rates and other health complications that may result from improper and lately identifying underweight, overweight, and obese members in IDP camps, the researcher collect Datasets from the IDP camps, trained, and developed a Random Forest ensemble model of supervised learning that will aids the medical practitioner in early detection and prediction of the weight category of IDPs. After hyper-parameter tuning and feature selection, the Random forest machine learning algorithms identify three significant parameters from the dataset's original 10 parameters to use as the model parameter. The highest accuracy obtained was 92% on the test dataset and 96% on the training dataset for the Random Forest (RF) Classifier using 3 features, while the accuracy of 83% was obtained on the test dataset and 87% on the training dataset for the RF Classifier using 10 features.",

        "abstract": "Causal relationships in a data play vital role in decision making. Identification of causal association in data is one of the important areas of research in data analytics. Simple correlations between data variables reveal the degree of linear relationship. Partial correlation explains the association between two variables within the control of other related variables. Partial association test explains the causality in data. In this paper a couple of causal relationship discovery strategies are proposed using the design of partial association tree that makes use of partial association test among variables. These decision trees are different from normal decision trees in terms of construction, scalability, interpretability and the ability of identifying causality in data. Normal Decision Trees are supervised machine learning approach to classify data based on a labeled attribute values. Variants of partial association trees are constructed as a part of analytics on a number of healthcare datasets. The applicability of design variants are carefully analyzed through this experimentation. In the above said experimentation it is found that the causation in data is not existed in data in some situations and sometimes the existing causality cannot be extracted where low associated dimensions are involved in data and hiding the underlying causality. One of the variants of proposed algorithms which was named dimensionality reduced partial association tree, did well in extracting causal association in case of a hidden causality in data.",

        "abstract": "The widespread influence of social media impacts every aspect of life, including the healthcare sector. Although medics and health professionals are the final decision makers, the advice and recommendations obtained from fellow patients are significant. In this context, the present paper explores the topics of discussion posted by breast cancer patients and survivors on online forums. The study examines an online forum, Breastcancer.org, maps the discussion entries to several topics, and proposes a machine learning model based on a classification algorithm to characterize the topics. To explore the topics of breast cancer patients and survivors, approximately 1000 posts are selected and manually labeled with annotations. In contrast, millions of posts are available to build the labels. A semi-supervised learning technique is used to build the labels for the unlabeled data; hence, the large data are classified using a deep learning algorithm. The deep learning algorithm BiLSTM with BERT word embedding technique provided a better f1-score of 79.5%. This method is able to classify the following topics: medication reviews, clinician knowledge, various treatment options, seeking and providing support, diagnostic procedures, financial issues and implications for everyday life. What matters the most for the patients is coping with everyday living as well as seeking and providing emotional and informational support. The approach and findings show the potential of studying social media to provide insight into patients' experiences with cancer like critical health problems.",

        "abstract": "Background Unplanned readmission of a hospitalized patient is an extremely undesirable outcome as the patient may have been exposed to additional risks. The rates of unplanned readmission are, therefore, regarded as an important performance indicator for the medical quality of a hospital and healthcare system. Identifying high-risk patients likely to suffer from readmission before release benefits both the patients and the medical providers. The emergence of machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities to develop efficient discharge decision-making support system for physicians. Methods and Findings We used supervised machine learning approaches for ICU readmission prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the MIMIC-III to predict the ICU readmission of patients within 30 days of their discharge. We have utilized recent machine learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), by this we have been able incorporate the multivariate features of EHRs and capture sudden fluctuations in chart event features (e.g. glucose and heart rate) that are significant in time series with temporal dependencies, which cannot be properly captured by traditional static models, but can be captured by our proposed deep neural network based model. We incorporate multiple types of features including chart events, demographic, and ICD9 embeddings. Our machine learning models identifies ICU readmissions at a higher sensitivity rate (0.742) and an improved Area Under the Curve (0.791) compared with traditional methods. We also illustrate the importance of each portion of the features and different combinations of the models to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Conclusion Our manuscript highlights the ability of machine learning models to improve our ICU decision making accuracy, and is a real-world example of precision medicine in hospitals. These data-driven results enable clinicians to make assisted decisions within their patient cohorts. This knowledge could have immediate implications for hospitals by improving the detection of possible readmission. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, hospital administration, allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately individualized clinical care.",

Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of ECG signals assist human experts in the timely diagnosis of cardiac diseases and help save precious lives. This research aims at digitizing a dataset of images of ECG records into time series signals and then applying deep learning (DL) techniques on the digitized dataset. State-of-the-art DL techniques are proposed for the classification of the ECG signals into different cardiac classes. Multiple DL models, including a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a self-supervised learning (SSL)-based model using autoencoders are explored and compared in this study. The models are trained on the dataset generated from ECG plots of patients from various healthcare institutes in Pakistan. First, the ECG images are digitized, segmenting the lead II heartbeats, and then the digitized signals are passed to the proposed deep learning models for classification. Among the different DL models used in this study, the proposed CNN model achieves the highest accuracy of \u223c92%. The proposed model is highly accurate and provides fast inference for real-time and direct monitoring of ECG signals that are captured from the electrodes (sensors) placed on different parts of the body. Using the digitized form of ECG signals instead of images for the classification of cardiac arrhythmia allows cardiologists to utilize DL models directly on ECG signals from an ECG machine for the real-time and accurate monitoring of ECGs.",

        "abstract": "Background Suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) has been well-established as a risk factor for offending. However, the majority of patients with an SSD do not show aggressive or criminal behavior. Yet, there is little research on clinical key features distinguishing offender from non-offender patients. Previous results point to poorer impulse control, higher levels of excitement, tension, and hostility, and worse overall cognitive functioning in offender populations. This study aimed to detect the most indicative distinguishing clinical features between forensic and general psychiatric patients with SSD based on the course of illness and the referenced hospitalization in order to facilitate a better understanding of the relationship between violent and non-violent offenses and SSD. Methods Our study population consisted of forensic psychiatric patients (FPPs) with a diagnosis of F2x (ICD-10) or 295.x (ICD-9) and a control group of general psychiatric patients (GPPs) with the same diagnosis, totaling 740 patients. Patients were evaluated regarding their medical (and, if applicable, criminal) history and the referenced psychiatric hospitalization. Supervised machine learning (ML) was used to exploratively evaluate predictor variables and their interplay and rank them in accordance with their discriminative power. Results Out of 194 possible predictor variables, the following 6 turned out to have the highest influence on the model: olanzapine equivalent at discharge from the referenced hospitalization, a history of antipsychotic prescription, a history of antidepressant, benzodiazepine or mood stabilizer prescription, medication compliance, outpatient treatment(s) in the past, and the necessity of compulsory measures. Out of the seven algorithms applied, gradient boosting emerged as the most suitable, with an AUC of 0.86 and a balanced accuracy of 77.5%. Discussion Our study aimed to identify the most influential illness-related predictors, distinguishing between FPP and GPP with SSD, thus shedding light on key differences between the two groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare a homogenous sample of FPP and GPP with SSD regarding their symptom severity and course of illness using highly sophisticated statistical approaches with the possibility of evaluating the interplay of all factors at play.",

        "abstract": "Ensemble models such as gradient boosting and random forests are proven to offer the best predictive performance on a wide variety of supervised learning problems. The high performance of these black box models, however, comes at a cost of model interpretability. They are also inadequate to meet regulatory demands and explainability needs of organizations. The model interpretability in high performance black-box models is achieved with the help of post-hoc explainable models such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This paper presents an alternate intrinsic classifier model that extracts a class of higher order patterns and embeds them into an interpretable learning model. More specifically, the proposed model extracts novel High Utility Gain (HUG) patterns that capture higher order interactions, transforms the model input data into a new space, and applies interpretable classifier methods on the transformed space. We conduct rigorous experiments on forty benchmark binary and multi-class classification datasets to evaluate the proposed model against the state-of-the-art ensemble and interpretable classifier models. The proposed model was comprehensively assessed on three key dimensions: 1) quality of predictions using classifier measures such as accuracy, $F_{1}$ , AUC, H-measure, and logistic loss, 2) computational performance on large and high-dimensional data, and 3) interpretability aspects. The HUG-based learning model was found to deliver performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art ensemble models. Our model was also found to achieve 2-40% (45%) prediction quality (interpretability) improvements with significantly lower computational requirements over other interpretable classifier models. Furthermore, we present case studies in finance and healthcare domains and generate one- and two-dimensional HUG profiles to illustrate the interpretability aspects of our HUG models. The proposed solution offers an alternate approach to build high performance and transparent machine learning classifier models. We hope that our ML solution help organizations meet their growing regulatory and explainability needs.",

        "abstract": "To personalize nutrition, the purpose of this study was to examine five key genes in the folate metabolism pathway, and dietary parameters and related interactive parameters as predictors of colorectal cancer (CRC) by measuring the healthy eating index (HEI) in multiethnic families. The five genes included methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 and 1298, methionine synthase (MTR) 2756, methionine synthase reductase (MTRR 66), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 19bp, and they were used to compute a total gene mutation score. We included 53 families, 53 CRC patients and 53 paired family friend members of diverse population groups in Southern California. We measured multidimensional data using the ensemble bootstrap forest method to identify variables of importance within domains of genetic, demographic, and dietary parameters to achieve dimension reduction. We then constructed predictive generalized regression (GR) modeling with a supervised machine learning validation procedure with the target variable (cancer status) being specified to validate the results to allow enhanced prediction and reproducibility. The results showed that the CRC group had increased total gene mutation scores compared to the family members (p < 0.05). Using the Akaike\u2019s information criterion and Leave-One-Out cross validation GR methods, the HEI was interactive with thiamine (vitamin B1), which is a new finding for the literature. The natural food sources for thiamine include whole grains, legumes, and some meats and fish which HEI scoring included as part of healthy portions (versus limiting portions on salt, saturated fat and empty calories). Additional predictors included age, as well as gender and the interaction of MTHFR 677 with overweight status (measured by body mass index) in predicting CRC, with the cancer group having more men and overweight cases. The HEI score was significant when split at the median score of 77 into greater or less scores, confirmed through the machine-learning recursive tree method and predictive modeling, although an HEI score of greater than 80 is the US national standard set value for a good diet. The HEI and healthy eating are modifiable factors for healthy living in relation to dietary parameters and cancer prevention, and they can be used for personalized nutrition in the precision-based healthcare era.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare professionals are known to suffer from workplace stress and burnout, which can negatively affect their empathy for patients and quality of care. While existing research has identified factors associated with wellbeing and empathy in healthcare professionals, these efforts are typically focused on the group level, ignoring potentially important individual differences and implications for individualized intervention approaches. In the current study, we implemented N-of-1 personalized machine learning (PML) to predict wellbeing and empathy in healthcare professionals at the individual level, leveraging ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and smartwatch wearable data. A total of 47 mood and lifestyle feature variables (relating to sleep, diet, exercise, and social connections) were collected daily for up to three months followed by applying eight supervised machine learning (ML) models in a PML pipeline to predict wellbeing and empathy separately. Predictive insight into the model architecture was obtained using Shapley statistics for each of the best-fit personalized models, ranking the importance of each feature for each participant. The best-fit model and top features varied across participants, with anxious mood (13/19) and depressed mood (10/19) being the top predictors in most models. Social connection was a top predictor for wellbeing in 9/12 participants but not for empathy models (1/7). Additionally, empathy and wellbeing were the top predictors of each other in 64% of cases. These findings highlight shared and individual features of wellbeing and empathy in healthcare professionals and suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing modifiable factors to improve wellbeing and empathy will likely be suboptimal. In the future, such personalized models may serve as actionable insights for healthcare professionals that lead to increased wellness and quality of patient care.",

This study aimed to predict these outcomes in Rwanda using supervised machine learning algorithms. Methods This cross-sectional study utilized data from the Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (RDHS, 2019\u20132020) involving 14,634 women. K-fold cross-validation (k = 10) and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) were used to manage dataset partitioning and class imbalance. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the prevalence and risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Seven machine learning algorithms were assessed for their accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Results Of the pregnancies analyzed, 93.4% resulted in live births, while 4.5% ended in miscarriage, and 2.1% in stillbirth. Advanced maternal age(>30 years),women aged 30\u201334 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.755; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.085\u201310.074; p < 0.001), 35\u201339 years (AOR = 8.458; 95% CI = 4.507\u201310.571; p < 0.001), 40\u201344 years (AOR = 11.86; 95% CI = 6.250\u201321.842; p < 0.001), and 45\u201349 years (AOR = 14.233; 95% CI = 7.359\u201325.922; p < 0.001), compared to those aged 15\u201319 years, and multiple unions (polyandry) (AOR = 1.320; 95% CI = 1.104\u20131.573, p = 0.002), and women not visited by healthcare provider during pregnancy (AOR = 1.421; 95%CI = 1.300\u20131.611, p<0.001) were factors associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In contrast, being married (AOR = 0.894; 95% CI = 0.787\u20130.966) and attending at least two antenatal care (ANC) visits (AOR = 0.801; 95% CI = 0.664\u20130.961) were linked to reduced risk. The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model outperformed other ML Models in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes, achieving 86% accuracy, 89% precision, 97% recall, 93% F1 score, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.842. The ML models constantly highlighted that woman with advanced maternal age, those in multiple unions, and inadequate ANC were more susceptible to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms, particularly KNN, are effective in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes, facilitating early intervention and improved maternal and neonatal care.",

Methods Regression models were established based on RF, KNN, SVM, and XGB to predict the length of hospital stay using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2, while classification models were established based on RF, KNN, SVM, NN, and XGB to predict risk of prolonged hospital stay using accuracy, PPV, NPV, specificity, sensitivity, and kappa, and visualization evaluation based on AUROC, AUPRC, calibration curves and decision curves of all models were used for internally validation. Results In regression models, XGB model performed best in the internal validation (RMSE = 16.81, MAE = 10.39, MAPE = 0.98, R2 = 0.47) to predict the length of hospital stay, while in classification models, NN model presented good fitting and stable features and performed best in testing sets, with excellent accuracy (0.7623), PPV (0.7853), NPV (0.7092), sensitivity (0.8754), specificity (0.5882), and kappa (0.4672), and further visualization evaluation indicated that the largest AUROC (0.9779), AUPRC (0.773) and well-performed calibration curve and decision curve in the internal validation. Conclusion This study showed that XGB model was effective in predicting the length of hospital stay, while NN model was effective in predicting the risk of prolonged hospitalization in PLWH. Based on predictive models, an intelligent medical prediction system may be developed to effectively predict the length of stay and risk of HIV patients according to their medical records, which helped reduce the waste of healthcare resources.",

        "abstract": "One of the critical issues in medical data analysis is accurately predicting a patient\u2019s risk of heart disease, which is vital for early intervention and reducing mortality rates. Early detection allows for timely treatment and continuous monitoring by healthcare providers, which is essential but often limited by the inability of medical professionals to provide constant patient supervision. Early detection of cardiac problems and continuous patient monitoring by physicians can help reduce death rates. Doctors cannot constantly have contact with patients, and heart disease detection is not always accurate. By offering a more solid foundation for prediction and decision-making based on data provided by healthcare sectors worldwide, machine learning (ML) could help physicians with the prediction and detection of HD. This study aims to use different feature selection strategies to produce an accurate ML algorithm for early heart disease prediction. We have chosen features using chi-square, ANOVA, and mutual information methods. The three feature groups chosen were SF-1, SF-2, and SF-3. The study employed ten machine learning algorithms to determine the most accurate technique and feature subset fit. The classification algorithms used include support vector machines (SVM), XGBoost, bagging, decision trees (DT), and random forests (RF). We evaluated the proposed heart disease prediction technique using a private dataset, a public dataset, and different cross-validation methods. We used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to eliminate inconsistent data and discover the machine learning algorithm that achieves the most accurate heart disease predictions. Healthcare providers might identify early-stage heart disease quickly and cheaply with the proposed method. We have used the most effective ML algorithm to create a mobile app that instantly predicts heart disease based on the input symptoms. The experimental results demonstrated that the XGBoost algorithm performed optimally when applied to the combined datasets and the SF-2 feature subset. It had 97.57% accuracy, 96.61% sensitivity, 90.48% specificity, 95.00% precision, a 92.68% F1 score, and a 98% AUC. We have developed an explainable AI method based on SHAP approaches to understand how the system makes its final predictions.",

Various applications, such as medical images analysis, medical images processing, text understanding, and speech recognition, have been using deep learning, and it has been providing rather promising results. Both supervised and unsupervised approaches are being used to extract and learn features as well as for the multi-level representation of pattern recognition and classification. Hence, the way of prediction, recognition, and diagnosis in various domains of healthcare including the abdomen, lung cancer, brain tumor, skeletal bone age assessment, and so on, have been transformed and improved significantly by deep learning. By considering a wide range of deep-learning applications, the main aim of this paper is to present a detailed survey on emerging research of deep-learning models for bone age assessment (e.g., segmentation, prediction, and classification). An enormous number of scientific research publications related to bone age assessment using deep learning are explored, studied, and presented in this survey. Furthermore, the emerging trends of this research domain have been analyzed and discussed. Finally, a critical discussion section on the limitations of deep-learning models has been presented.

        "abstract": "Introduction Heart failure (HF) is increasingly common and associated with excess morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Treatment of HF can alter the disease trajectory and reduce clinical events in HF. However, many cases of HF remain undetected until presentation with more advanced symptoms, often requiring hospitalisation. Predicting incident HF is challenging and statistical models are limited by performance and scalability in routine clinical practice. An HF prediction model implementable in nationwide electronic health records (EHRs) could enable targeted diagnostics to enable earlier identification of HF. Methods and analysis We will investigate a range of development techniques (including logistic regression and supervised machine learning methods) on routinely collected primary care EHRs to predict risk of new-onset HF over 1, 5 and 10 years prediction horizons. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)-GOLD dataset will be used for derivation (training and testing) and the CPRD-AURUM dataset for external validation. Both comprise large cohorts of patients, representative of the population of England in terms of age, sex and ethnicity.

        "abstract": "Identifying intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant patients is essential for the prompt and optimal treatment of Kawasaki disease, suggesting the need for effective risk assessment tools. Data-driven approaches have the potential to identify the high-risk individuals by capturing the complex patterns of real-world data. To enable clinically applicable prediction of intravenous immunoglobulin resistance addressing the incompleteness of clinical data and the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, a multi-stage method is developed by integrating data missing pattern mining and intelligible models. First, co-clustering is adopted to characterize the block-wise data missing patterns by simultaneously grouping the clinical features and patients to enable (a) group-based feature selection and missing data imputation and (b) patient subgroup-specific predictive models considering the availability of data. Second, feature selection is performed using the group Lasso to uncover group-specific risk factors. Third, the Explainable Boosting Machine, which is an interpretable learning method based on generalized additive models, is applied for the prediction of each patient subgroup. The experiments using real-world Electronic Health Records demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework for predictive modeling compared with a set of benchmark methods. This study highlights the integration of co-clustering and supervised learning methods for incomplete clinical data mining, and promotes data-driven approaches to investigate predictors and effective algorithms for decision making in healthcare.",

        "title": "Justification-Based Reliability in Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "With the advent of Deep Learning, the field of machine learning (ML) has surpassed human-level performance on diverse classification tasks. At the same time, there is a stark need to characterize and quantify reliability of a model's prediction on individual samples. This is especially true in applications of such models in safety-critical domains of industrial control and healthcare. To address this need, we link the question of reliability of a model's individual prediction to the epistemic uncertainty of the model's prediction. More specifically, we extend the theory of Justified True Belief (JTB) in epistemology, created to study the validity and limits of human-acquired knowledge, towards characterizing the validity and limits of knowledge in supervised classifiers. We present an analysis of neural network classifiers linking the reliability of its prediction on a test input to characteristics of the support gathered from the input and hidden layers of the network. We hypothesize that the JTB analysis exposes the epistemic uncertainty (or ignorance) of a model with respect to its inference, thereby allowing for the inference to be only as strong as the justification permits. We explore various forms of support (for e.g., k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and \u2113p-norm based) generated for an input, using the training data to construct a justification for the prediction with that input. Through experiments conducted on simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can provide reliability for individual predictions and characterize regions where such reliability cannot be ascertained.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Predictive analytics (PA) is a new trending approach in the field of healthcare that uses machine learning to build a prediction model using supervised learning algorithms. Isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (iCABG), an open-heart surgery, is commonly performed in the treatment of coronary heart disease. Aim The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a model to predict postoperative length of stay (PLoS) for iCABG patients using supervised machine learning techniques, and to identify the features with the highest contribution to the model. Methods This is a retrospective study that uses historic data of adult patients who underwent isolated CABG (iCABG). After initial data pre-processing, data imputation using the kNN method was applied. The study used five prediction models using Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and k Nearest Neighbor algorithms. Data imbalance was managed using the following widely used methods: oversampling, undersampling, \u201cBoth\u201d, and random over-sampling examples (ROSE). The features selection process was conducted using the Boruta method. Two techniques were applied to examine the performance of the models, (70%, 30%) split and cross-validation, respectively. Models were evaluated by comparing their performance using AUC and other metrics. Results In the final dataset, six distinct features and 621 instances were used to develop the models. A total of 20 models were developed using R statistical software. The model generated using Random Forest with \u201cBoth\u201d resampling method and cross-validation technique was deemed the best fit (AUC=0.81; F1 score=0.82; and recall=0.82). Attributes found to be highly predictive of PLoS were pulmonary artery systolic, age, height, EuroScore II, intra-aortic balloon pump used, and complications during operation. Conclusion This study demonstrates the significance and effectiveness of building a model that predicts PLoS for iCABG patients using patient specifications and pre-/intra-operative measures.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that has emerged as a significant global health challenge, affecting millions worldwide. It is characterised by cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioural changes, significantly burdening patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Early diagnosis and effective intervention remain critical yet challenging due to the complex nature of the disease and its heterogeneous progression. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on invasive, expensive, and often time-consuming procedures, underscoring the urgent need for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, has revolutionised the field of medical research by enabling the analysis of complex and high-dimensional datasets. In Alzheimer\u2019s research, ML has shown immense potential in enhancing.diagnostic accuracy, predicting disease progression, and personalising treatment plans. ML models leverage data from various sources, including neuroimaging, genomics, biomarkers, and clinical records, to identify subtle patterns and accurately predict outcomes. Applying supervised learning, deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data, and unsupervised clustering algorithms for patient stratification have significantly advanced the field.This paper focuses on three critical areas: (1) early diagnosis of AD through ML-based analysis of neuroimaging and biomarkers, (2) prediction of disease progression using longitudinal data and predictive models, and (3) optimisation of treatment plans and personalised care through reinforcement learning and predictive analytics. The study also explores the challenges associated with ML applications, such as data heterogeneity, interpretability, and ethical concerns, and discusses potential solutions to address these barriers.In conclusion, machine learning represents a transformative tool in Alzheimer\u2019s research. It promises to improve early detection, enhance disease management, and pave the way for precision medicine. Its integration into clinical practice can potentially significantly mitigate the global burden of AD.",

        "abstract": "Background Accurate prediction of future incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease may facilitate intervention strategy to delay disease onset. Existing AD risk prediction models require collection of biospecimen (genetic, CSF, or blood samples), cognitive testing, or brain imaging. Conversely, EHR provides an opportunity to build a completely automated risk prediction model based on individuals\u2019 history of health and healthcare. We tested machine learning models to predict future incidence of AD using administrative EHR in individuals aged 65 or older. Methods We obtained de-identified EHR from Korean elders age above 65 years old (N=40,736) collected between 2002 and 2010 in the Korean National Health Insurance Service database system. Consisting of Participant Insurance Eligibility database, Healthcare Utilization database, and Health Screening database, our EHR contain 4,894 unique clinical features including ICD-10 codes, medication codes, laboratory values, history of personal and family illness, and socio-demographics. Our event of interest was new incidence of AD defined from the EHR based on both AD codes and prescription of anti-dementia medication. Two definitions were considered: a more stringent one requiring a diagnosis and dementia medication resulting in n=614 cases (\u201cdefinite AD\u201d) and a more liberal one requiring only diagnostic codes (n=2,026; \u201cprobable AD\u201d). We trained and validated a random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression to predict incident AD in 1,2,3, and 4 subsequent years using the EHR available since 2002. The length of the EHR used in the models ranged from 1,571 to 2,239 days. Model training, validation, and testing was done using iterative (5 times), nested, stratified 5-fold cross validation. Results Average duration of EHR was 1,936 days in AD and 2,694 days in controls. For predicting future incidence of AD using the \u201cdefinite AD\u201d outcome, the machine learning models showed the best performance in 1 year prediction with AUC of 0.781; in 2 year, 0.739; in 3 year, 0.686; in 4 year, 0.662. Using \u201cprobable AD\u201d outcome, the machine learning models showed the best performance in 1 year prediction with AUC of 0.730; in 2 year, 0.645; in 3 year, 0.575; in 4 year, 0.602. Important clinical features selected in logistic regression included hemoglobin level (b=-0.902), age (b=0.689), urine protein level (b=0.303), prescription of Lodopin (antipsychotic drug) (b=0.303), and prescription of Nicametate Citrate (vasodilator) (b=-0.297). Conclusion This study demonstrates that EHR can detect risk for incident AD. This approach could enable risk-specific stratification of elders for better targeted clinical trials. Key Points Question Can machine learning be used to predict future incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease using electronic health records? Findings We developed and validated supervised machine learning models using the HER data from 40,736 South Korean elders (age above 65 years old). Our model showed acceptable accuracy in predicting up to four year subsequent incidence of AD. Meaning This study shows the potential utility of the administrative EHR data in predicting risk for AD using data-driven machine learning to support physicians at the point of care.",

This condition has a significant impact on a considerable number of individuals. Consequently, the study, analysis, and characterization of this pathology are of paramount importance. Electroencephalography (EEG) is frequently utilized in the diagnostic assessment of various brain disorders due to its non-intrusiveness, excellent resolution and ease of placement. However, the manual analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings can be a complex and time-consuming task for healthcare professionals. Therefore, the automated analysis of EEG recordings can help alleviate the burden on doctors and provide valuable insights to support clinical diagnosis. Many studies are working along these lines. In this research paper, the authors propose a machine learning (ML) method based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm for analyzing EEG signals. The study compares the performance of the proposed XGB-based approach with four other supervised ML systems. According to the results, the proposed XGB-based method demonstrates superior performance, with an AUC value of 0.94 and an accuracy value of 0.94, surpassing the other compared methods. The implemented system exhibits high accuracy and robustness in accurately classifying schizophrenia patients based on EEG recordings. This method holds the potential to be implemented as a valuable complementary tool for clinical use in hospitals, supporting clinicians in their clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

Conventional centrifugation methods for separation are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and off-chip, necessitating innovative alternatives. This study introduces \u201cIntelligent Microfluidics\u201d, an ML-integrated microfluidic platform designed to optimize plasma separation through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The trifurcation microchannel, modeled using COMSOL Multiphysics, achieved plasma yields of 90\u201395% across varying inflow velocities (0.0001\u20130.05 m/s). The input fluid parameters mimic the blood viscosity and density used with appropriate boundary conditions and fluid dynamics to optimize the designed microchannels. Eight supervised ML algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were employed to predict key performance parameters, with ANN achieving the highest predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.97). Unlike traditional methods, this platform demonstrates scalability, portability, and rapid diagnostic potential, revolutionizing clinical workflows by enabling efficient plasma separation for real-time, point-of-care diagnostics. By incorporating a detailed comparative analysis with previous studies, including computational efficiency, our work underscores the superior performance of ML-enhanced microfluidic systems.

In this context, numerous intelligent machine learning and data mining approaches including Support vector machine (SVM) have been exploited for diabetes management.SVM is a prevailing supervised and discriminative data classifier which assists the healthcare and biomedical professionals to ascertain unknown data patterns by training a large volume of real-time data. Since this database is the private asset, the sensitive information should be safeguarded without compromising the utility. Even though SVM is a fast and accurate machine learning technique, it does not have the capacity to represent semantically the classification and reasoning rules which can enable more precise classification. Therefore, the objective of this research is three-fold. Firstly, in order to protect sensitive clinical data, we introduce the Kronecker product and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) based coefficient generation technique. Secondly, we design diabetes ontology to define domain concepts and relationships and allow medical datamining. Finally, we implement the Ontology-based Support Vector Machine (Ont-SVM) classifier by assimilating privacy protection, ontology, and SVM-based classifier for the diagnosis of diabetes.The experimental results on a real-world dataset, the Pima Indian database at the UCI repository, illustrate that the proposed Ont-SVM outperforms other existing approaches in terms of privacy, accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.",

The COVID-19 pandemic caused due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of the most researched healthcare topics worldwide. Machine learning algorithms can find efficient and reliable ways to predict the COVID-19 from vast amounts of existing health care data, allowing faster, effective, and more accurate diagnosis with lower risk based on the symptoms. Based on the countrywide data published by the Israeli Ministry of Health, we propose a system that detects COVID-19 instances using simple variables. The COVID-19 dataset used in the study consisted of 278848 patients samples with five different symptoms, namely cough, fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, and headache, apart from other basic information like age, gender, and test indication excluding confirmed COVID-19 result. The data was analyzed using traditional supervised machine learning algorithms namely, Decision tree, Support vector machine, Random Forest, Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, and Naive Bayes based on eight cofactors with high accuracy rate (\u2265 0.9450). Apart from Support vector machine, all other algorithms displayed better performance based on the AUC score calculated using the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. This study also highlights the significant differences between precision, recall and accuracy for each model. Graphical Abstract",

        "abstract": "Monkeypox has emerged as a fast-spreading disease around the world and an outbreak has been reported in 42 countries so far. Although the clinical attributes of Monkeypox are similar to that of Smallpox, skin lesions and rashes caused by Monkeypox often resemble that of other pox types, e.g., Chickenpox and Cowpox. This scenario makes an early diagnosis of Monkeypox challenging for the healthcare professional just by observing the visual appearance of lesions and rashes. The rarity of Monkeypox before the current outbreak further created a knowledge gap among healthcare professionals around the world. To tackle this challenging situation, scientists are taking motivation from the success of supervised machine learning in COVID-19 detection. However, the lack of Monkeypox skin image data is making the bottleneck of using machine learning in Monkeypox detection from skin images of patients. Therefore, in this project, we introduce the Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset (MSID), the largest of its kind so far. We used web-scrapping to collect Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Smallpox, Cowpox and Measles infected skin as well as healthy skin images to build a comprehensive image database and made it publicly available. We believe that our database will facilitate the development of baseline machine learning algorithms for early Monkeypox detection in clinical settings.

        "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic disease spread by SARS-COV-2 single-strand structure RNA virus belongs to the 7th generation of the coronavirus family. Following an unusual replication mechanism, its extreme ease of transmissibility has put many counties under lockdown. With a cure for the infection uncertain in the near future, the pressure currently lies in the current healthcare infrastructure, policies, government activities, and behaviour of the people to contain the virus. This research seeks to understand the spreading patterns of the COVID-19 virus through exponential growth modelling and identifies countries that have showed an initial sign of containment until 26th March 2020. Post identification of countries that have shown an initial sign of containment, predictive supervised machine learning models were built with infrastructure, environment, policies, and infection related independent variables. For the purpose, COVID-19 infection data across 42 countries were used. Logistic regression results shows a positive significant relationship of healthcare infrastructure and lockdown policies on the sign of early containment in countries. Machine learning models based on logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machines were developed and are seen to have accuracies between 76.2% to 92.9% to predict early sign of infection containment. Other policies and activities taken by countries to contain the infection are also discussed.",

Complex tasks like speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment classification, weather prediction, etc., are now performed by well-trained RNNs. Local or cloud-based GPU machines are used to train them. However, inference is now shifting to miniature, mobile, IoT devices and even micro-controllers. Due to their colossal memory and computing requirements, mapping RNNs directly onto resource-constrained platforms is arcane and challenging. The efficacy of edge-intelligent RNNs (EI-RNNs) must satisfy both performance and memory-fitting requirements at the same time without compromising one for the other. This study\u2019s aim was to provide an empirical evaluation and optimization of historic as well as recent RNN architectures for high-performance and low-memory footprint goals. We focused on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks based on wearable sensor data for embedded healthcare applications. We evaluated and optimized six different recurrent units, namely Vanilla RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), Fast Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (FGRNNs), Fast Recurrent Neural Networks (FRNNs), and Unitary Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (UGRNNs) on eight publicly available time-series HAR datasets. We used the hold-out and cross-validation protocols for training the RNNs. We used low-rank parameterization, iterative hard thresholding, and spare retraining compression for RNNs. We found that efficient training (i.e., dataset handling and preprocessing procedures, hyperparameter tuning, and so on, and suitable compression methods (like low-rank parameterization and iterative pruning) are critical in optimizing RNNs for performance and memory efficiency.

        "abstract": "The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized healthcare and education. These AI systems, trained on vast datasets using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques and large language models (LLMs), can generate text, images, and videos, offering new avenues for enhancing surgical education. Their ability to produce interactive learning resources, procedural guidance, and feedback post-virtual simulations makes them valuable in educating surgical trainees. However, technical challenges such as data quality issues, inaccuracies, and uncertainties around model interpretability remain barriers to widespread adoption. This review explores the integration of generative AI into surgical training, assessing its potential to enhance learning and teaching methodologies. While generative AI has demonstrated promise for improving surgical education, its integration must be approached cautiously, ensuring AI input is balanced with traditional supervision and mentorship from experienced surgeons. Given that generative AI models are not yet suitable as standalone tools, a blended learning approach that integrates AI capabilities with conventional educational strategies should be adopted. The review also addresses limitations and challenges, emphasizing the need for more robust research on different AI models and their applications across various surgical subspecialties. The lack of standardized frameworks and tools to assess the quality of AI outputs in surgical education necessitates rigorous oversight to ensure accuracy and reliability in training settings. By evaluating the current state of generative AI in surgical education, this narrative review highlights the potential for future innovation and research, encouraging ongoing exploration of AI in enhancing surgical education and training.",

Although these spam communications irritate users and occasionally con unsuspecting users, the spammers and ad businesses benefit handsomely from them. This paper suggested a method for categorizing ham and spam SMS using supervised machine learning approaches. Features are extracted from data using feature extraction techniques like bag-of- words and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The imbalance in the SMS dataset we used was addressed by applying both oversampling and under sampling techniques.

While medical data about healthcare and health obtained from questionnaire, the true positive rate of cancers predicted by traditional methods is low. Machine learning can provide a pattern for classification for types of cancer (mainly including lung cancer, liver cancer, upper gastrointestinal cancer, lower gastrointestinal cancer and breast cancer) using instances of early questionnaire screening. The screening covered 3411 respondents in this study. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to generate attributes, coupled with artificial neural network (ANN) technology to conduct cancer prediction by providing 28 attributes into models. While deep belief network (DBN) is used for unsupervised training and extracting relevant attributes. Extreme learning machine (ELM) optimizes DBN and conducts supervised classification. Back propagation (BP) algorithm conducts supervised fine tuning. Finally, PCA-ANN and DBN-ELM-BP common cancers prediction models are established. The training set and testing set of PCA-ANN model gives 35.29% and 37.5% sensitivity, 98.36% and 98.33% specificity, 97.01% and 97.85% accuracy, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.7245 and 0.7221, respectively.

Therefore, an approach to mine/analysis/interpret these data and extract useful knowledge from this diverse big data sources emerges in order to extract the hidden pattern of data using computational algorithms from statistics, machine learning and information theory. However, inconsistency, duplication and repetition and misconducting with the different type of discrete and continuous data can cause erroneous decision-making. This paper focuses on providing a rules extraction and supervised-decision making methods for facilitating the fusion of BIM and 2D and 3D GIS-based information coupling with IoT stream data residing in a spatial database and 3D BIM data. The proposed methods can be used in those applications like Emergency Response, Evacuation Planning, Occupancy Mapping, and Urban Monitoring to Smart Multi-Buildings so that their input data mostly come from 2D and 3D GIS, BIM and IoT stream. This research focus on proposing the unified rules extraction and decision engine to help smart citizens and managers using BIM and GIS data to make smart decision rather than focus on applications in certain field of BIM and GIS.\n",

        "abstract": "Objective This study aimed to develop and validate predictive models using electronic health records (EHR) data to determine whether hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients would be admitted to alternative medical care or discharged home. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using deidentified data from the University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository. The study included 1,578 adult patients (\u226518 years) who tested positive for COVID-19 while hospitalized, comprising 960 (60.8%) female patients with a mean (SD) age of 51.86 (18.49) years and 618 (39.2%) male patients with a mean (SD) age of 54.35 (18.48) years. Machine learning (ML) model training involved cross-validation to assess their performance in predicting patient disposition. Results We developed and validated six supervised ML-based prediction models (logistic regression, Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forest, and support vector machine classifier) to predict patient discharge status. The models were evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), precision, accuracy, F1 score, and Brier score. The random forest classifier exhibited the highest performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.84 and an AUC of 0.72. Logistic regression (accuracy: 0.85, AUC: 0.71), k-nearest neighbor (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.63), decision tree (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.61), Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.66), and support vector machine classifier (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.67) also demonstrated valuable predictive capabilities. Significance This study\u2019s findings are crucial for efficiently allocating healthcare resources during pandemics like COVID-19. By harnessing ML techniques and EHR data, we can create predictive tools to identify patients at greater risk of severe symptoms based on their medical histories. The models developed here serve as a foundation for expanding the toolkit available to healthcare professionals and organizations.

        "title": "Decision Tree-based Modelling for Identification of Predictors of Blood Loss and Transfusion Requirement After Adult Spinal Deformity Surgery",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Multilevel fusions and complex osteotomies to restore global alignment in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery can lead to increased operative time and blood loss. In this regard, we assessed factors predictive of perioperative blood product transfusion in patients undergoing long posterior spinal fusion for ASD. Methods A single-institution retrospective review was conducted on 909 patients with ASD, age\u2009>\u200918 years, who underwent surgery for ASD with greater than 4 levels fused. Using conditional inference tree analysis, a machine learning methodology, we sought to predict the combination of variables that best predicted increased risk for intraoperative percent blood volume lost and perioperative blood product transfusion. Results Among the 909 patients included in the study, 377 (41.5%) received red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. The conditional inference tree analysis identified greater than 13 levels fused, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score\u2009>\u20091, a history of hypertension, 3-column osteotomy, pelvic fixation, and operative time\u2009>\u20098 hours, as significant risk factors for perioperative RBC transfusion. The best predictors for the subgroup with the highest risk for intraoperative percent blood volume lost (subgroup mean: 53.1%\u2009\u00b1\u200942.9%) were greater than 13 levels fused, ASA score\u2009>\u20091, preoperative hemoglobin\u2009<\u200913.6 g/dL, 3-column osteotomy, posterior column osteotomy, and pelvic fixation. Patients who underwent major blood transfusion intraoperatively had significantly longer length of stay (8.5 days) versus those who did not (6.1 days) (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). The overall 90-day complication rate in patients who underwent major blood transfusion intraoperatively was 49%, compared with 19% in those who did not (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). By multivariate regression analysis, patients with a preoperative hemoglobin\u2009>\u200913.0 were less likely to require major blood transfusion (odds ratio: 0.52, P\u2009=\u2009.046). Conclusions Using a supervised learning technique, this study demonstrates that greater than 13 levels fused, ASA score\u2009>\u20091, 3-column osteotomy, and pelvic fixation are consistent risk factors for increased intraoperative percent blood volume lost and perioperative RBC transfusion. The addition of having a preoperative hemoglobin\u2009<\u200913.6 g/dL or undergoing a posterior column osteotomy conferred the highest risk for intraoperative blood loss. This information can assist spinal deformity surgeons in identifying at-risk individuals and allocating healthcare resources. Level of Evidence 3.",

        "abstract": "The bacteraemia prediction is relevant because sepsis is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality. Bacteraemia prognosis primarily depends on a rapid diagnosis. The bacteraemia prediction would shorten up to 6 days the diagnosis, and, in conjunction with individual patient variables, should be considered to start the early administration of personalised antibiotic treatment and medical services, the election of specific diagnostic techniques and the determination of additional treatments, such as surgery, that would prevent subsequent complications. Machine learning techniques could help physicians make these informed decisions by predicting bacteraemia using the data already available in electronic hospital records. This study presents the application of machine learning techniques to these records to predict the blood culture\u2019s outcome, which would reduce the lag in starting a personalised antibiotic treatment and the medical costs associated with erroneous treatments due to conservative assumptions about blood culture outcomes. Six supervised classifiers were created using three machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours, on the electronic health records of hospital patients. The best approach to handle missing data was chosen and, for each machine learning technique, two classification models were created: the first uses the features known at the time of blood extraction, whereas the second uses four extra features revealed during the blood culture. The six classifiers were trained and tested using a dataset of 4357 patients with 117 features per patient. The models obtain predictions that, for the best case, are up to a state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.9%, a sensitivity of 87.4% and an AUC of 0.93. Our results provide cutting-edge metrics of interest in predictive medical models with values that exceed the medical practice threshold and previous results in the literature using classical modelling techniques in specific types of bacteraemia. Additionally, the consistency of results is reasserted because the three classifiers\u2019 importance ranking shows similar features that coincide with those that physicians use in their manual heuristics. Therefore, the efficacy of these machine learning techniques confirms their viability to assist in the aims of predictive and personalised medicine once the disease presents bacteraemia-compatible symptoms and to assist in improving the healthcare economy.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) integration in healthcare improves patient care while also making healthcare delivery systems more effective and economical. To fully realize the advantages of IoT in healthcare, it is imperative to overcome issues with data security, interoperability, and ethical considerations. IoT sensors periodically measure the health-related data of the patients and share it with a server for further evaluation. At the server, different machine learning algorithms are applied which help in early diagnosis of diseases and issue alerts in case vital signs are out of the normal range. Different cyber attacks can be launched on IoT devices which can result in compromised security and privacy of applications such as health care. In this paper, we utilize the publicly available Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) IoT dataset to model machine learning techniques for efficient detection of anomalous network traffic. The dataset consists of 33 types of IoT attacks which are divided into 7 main categories. In the current study, the dataset is pre-processed, and a balanced representation of classes is used in generating a non-biased supervised (Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Logistic Regression, Perceptron, Deep Neural Network) machine learning models. These models are analyzed further by eliminating highly correlated features, reducing dimensionality, minimizing overfitting, and speeding up training times. Random Forest was found to perform optimally across binary and multiclass classification of IoT Attacks with an approximate accuracy of 99.55% under both reduced and all feature space. This improvement was complimented by a reduction in computational response time which is essential for real-time attack detection and response.",

Low-cost and large-area compliant devices, as well as fast and effective computational algorithms, have been proposed in the last few years to facilitate distributed pressure sensing. One approach is to use electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to reconstruct the contact pressure distribution of piezoresistive materials. While tremendous success has been demonstrated, conventional algorithms may be unsuitable for real-time monitoring due to its computational demand and runtime. Moreover, the low resolution of reconstructed images is a well-known issue related to the regularization strategies typically employed for traditional EIT methods. Therefore, in this study, two different supervised machine learning (ML) approaches, namely, radial basis function networks and deep neural networks, were employed to efficiently solve the inverse EIT problem and improve the resolution of reconstructed pressure maps. The demonstration of high-resolution pressure mapping, specifically, for identifying pressure hotspots, was achieved using a carbon nanotube-based thin film integrated with foam.",

        "title": "Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks and Tree Models as Multifactorial Binary Predictors of Heart Disease and Failure",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant global health concern, causing an estimated 17.9 million deaths annually, which represents 31% of worldwide deaths. A significant proportion of CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, with one-third of these deaths occurring prematurely in individuals under 70 years old. Heart failure is a notable event within CVDs and emerges when the heart cannot efficiently pump blood to fulfill the body's requirements. This complex syndrome's origins are multifactorial and often arise from conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Large datasets with multiple features offer an opportunity for machine learning to aid in the early detection and prediction of heart failure.\nMETHODS: The study employed an unmatched case-control retrospective design. Supervised machine learning models were utilized, notably Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks (MLP-ANNs) and decision tree-based models, to predict heart failure disease using data from 918 patients. The open licensed dataset, a combination from five independent heart datasets, comprises 11 demographic and clinical features related to patient status. The MLP-ANN, equipped with a hidden layer and a hyperbolic tangent activation function, was trained on 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30%. Additionally, the study evaluated the decision tree model's performance through split-sample validation and 10-fold cross-validation.\nRESULTS: The ANN model demonstrated an accuracy of 88.10% in predicting heart disease (AUROC = 0.942) based on six factors and five covariates. The cross-validated tree model achieved an overall predictive accuracy of 84.3%. In contrast, the split-sample validated tree model, which used a balanced 50-50 data split for training and testing, attained an accuracy of 82.0%. OldPeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest) had the highest normalized importance calculated from the MLP ANN model.\nCONCLUSION: Machine learning predictions have gained importance in healthcare, presenting potential benefits in early detection and intervention, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare expenses. The study revealed that ANNs outperform decision tree models in accuracy for the dataset in use. Furthermore, the research emphasized the significance of the clinical feature \"Oldpeak\" in predicting heart failure through ANNs. ANNs can discern intricate relationships between variables and recognize non-linear interactions, a capability sometimes missed by decision tree models. However, the efficacy of machine learning models remains dependent on the quality and volume of the available data.",

The healthcare sector is under a tremendous burden, thus necessitating the prognosis of COVID-19 severity. This in-depth study of plasma proteome alteration provides insights into the host physiological response towards the infection and also reveals the potential prognostic markers of the disease. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we performed deep plasma proteome analysis in a cohort of 71 patients (20 COVID-19 negative, 18 COVID-19 non-severe, and 33 severe) to understand the disease dynamics. Of the 1200 proteins detected in the patient plasma, 38 proteins were identified to be differentially expressed between non-severe and severe groups. The altered plasma proteome revealed significant dysregulation in the pathways related to peptidase activity, regulated exocytosis, blood coagulation, complement activation, leukocyte activation involved in immune response, and response to glucocorticoid biological processes in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we employed supervised machine learning (ML) approaches using a linear support vector machine model to identify the classifiers of patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19. The model used a selected panel of 20 proteins and classified the samples based on the severity with a classification accuracy of 0.84. Putative biomarkers such as angiotensinogen and SERPING1 and ML-derived classifiers including the apolipoprotein B, SERPINA3, and fibrinogen gamma chain were validated by targeted mass spectrometry-based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays. We also employed an in silico screening approach against the identified target proteins for the therapeutic management of COVID-19. We shortlisted two FDA-approved drugs, namely, selinexor and ponatinib, which showed the potential of being repurposed for COVID-19 therapeutics. Overall, this is the first most comprehensive plasma proteome investigation of COVID-19 patients from the Indian population, and provides a set of potential biomarkers for the disease severity progression and targets for therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "Medical image analysis, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), plays a crucial role in modern healthcare diagnostics. However, the effectiveness of machine learning models hinges on their ability to generalize to diverse patient populations, presenting domain shift challenges. This study explores the domain shift problem in chest X-ray classification, focusing on cross-population variations, especially in underrepresented groups. We analyze the impact of domain shifts across three population datasets acting as sources using a Nigerian chest X-ray dataset acting as the target. Model performance is evaluated to assess disparities between source and target populations, revealing large discrepancies when the models trained on a source were applied to the target domain. To address with the evident domain shift among the populations, we propose a supervised adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) technique. The feature extractor is first trained on the source domain using a supervised loss function in ADA. The feature extractor is then frozen, and an adversarial domain discriminator is introduced to distinguish between the source and target domains. Adversarial training fine-tunes the feature extractor, making features from both domains indistinguishable, thereby creating domain-invariant features. The technique was evaluated on the Nigerian dataset, showing significant improvements in chest X-ray classification performance. The proposed model achieved a 90.08% accuracy and a 96% AUC score, outperforming existing approaches such as multi-task learning (MTL) and continual learning (CL). This research highlights the importance of developing domain-aware models in AI-driven healthcare, offering a solution to cross-population domain shift challenges in medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "Clinical support systems are affected by the issue of high variance in terms of chronic disorder prognosis. This uncertainty is one of the principal causes for the demise of large populations around the world suffering from some fatal diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Due to this reason, the diagnosis of this disease is of great concern for healthcare systems. In such a case, machine learning can be used as an effective tool to reduce the randomness in clinical decision making. Conventional methods for the detection of chronic kidney disease are not always accurate because of their high degree of dependency on several sets of biological attributes. Machine learning is the process of training a machine using a vast collection of historical data for the purpose of intelligent classification. This work aims at developing a machine-learning model that can use a publicly available data to forecast the occurrence of chronic kidney disease. A set of data preprocessing steps were performed on this dataset in order to construct a generic model. This set of steps includes the appropriate imputation of missing data points, along with the balancing of data using the SMOTE algorithm and the scaling of the features. A statistical technique, namely, the chi-squared test, is used for the extraction of the least-required set of adequate and highly correlated features to the output. For the model training, a stack of supervised-learning techniques is used for the development of a robust machine-learning model. Out of all the applied learning techniques, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) achieved the lowest false-negative rates and test accuracy, equal to 99.33% and 98.67%, respectively. However, SVM achieved better results than RF did when validated with 10-fold cross-validation.",

(3) Results: Of 147,358 inpatient encounters, 20,747 (13.9%) patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The final model selected was XGBoost, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.783 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.434. The most important features by Shapley Additive Explanations were days since last admission, discharge department, and inpatient length of stay.

This narrative review aims to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting neurological outcomes postcardiac resuscitation. The methodology involved a detailed review of all relevant recent studies of AI, different machine learning algorithms, prediction tools, and assessing their benefit in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation cases as compared to more traditional prognostic scoring systems and tools. Previously, outcome determining clinical, blood, and radiological factors were prone to other influencing factors like limited accuracy and time constraints. Studies conducted also emphasized that to predict poor neurological outcomes, a more multimodal approach helped adjust for confounding factors, interpret diverse datasets, and provide a reliable prognosis, which only demonstrates the need for AI to help overcome challenges faced. Advanced machine learning algorithms like artificial neural networks (ANN) using supervised learning by AI have improved the accuracy of prognostic models outperforming conventional models. Several real-world cases of effective AI-powered algorithm models have been cited here. Studies comparing machine learning tools like XGBoost, AI Watson, hyperspectral imaging, ChatGPT-4, and AI-based gradient boosting have noted their beneficial uses. AI could help reduce workload, healthcare costs, and help personalize care, process vast genetic and lifestyle data and help reduce side effects from treatments. Limitations of AI have been covered extensively in this article, including data quality, bias, privacy issues, and transparency. Our objectives should be to use more diverse data sources, use interpretable data output giving process explanation, validation method, and implement policies to safeguard patient data. Despite the limitations, the advancements already made by AI and its potential in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation cases has been quite promising and boosts a continually improving system, albeit requiring close human supervision with training and improving models, with plans to educate clinicians, the public and sharing collected data.",

In this study, a supervised ML model was developed in order to predict 9 common biomarkers widely used in clinical settings. These biomarkers included triglycerides, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, uric acid, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, high-density lipoproteins and albuminuria. During the validation test, it was observed that the ML models successfully predicted values within 5 and 10% error of the actual values. Out of the 121 female individuals tested, the following percentages of predicted values fell within this 10% range: 93% for albuminuria, 86% for waist circumference, 76% for BMI, and the lowest being 64% for systolic blood pressure and blood glucose. For the 119 male individuals tested, the percentages were as follows: 92% for albuminuria, 96% for waist circumference, 91% for BMI, 74% for blood glucose, and 68% for systolic blood pressure.

It is a leading cause of morbidity, resulting in a reduced quality of life even in developed societies, primarily affected by a sedentary lifestyle and often leading to mortality. Keeping track of blood glucose levels noninvasively has been made possible due to diverse breakthroughs in wearable sensor technology coupled with holistic digital healthcare. Efficient glucose management has been revolutionized by the development of continuous glucose monitoring sensors and wearable, non/minimally invasive devices that measure glucose concentration by exploiting different physical principles, e.g., glucose oxidase, fluorescence, or skin dielectric properties, and provide real-time measurements every 1\u20135 min. This paper presents a highly novel and completely non-invasive sweat sensor platform technology that can measure and report glucose concentrations from passively expressed human eccrine sweat using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and affinity capture probe functionalized sensor surfaces. The sensor samples 1\u20135 \u00b5L of sweat from the wearer every 1\u20135 min and reports sweat glucose from a machine learning algorithm that samples the analytical reference values from the electrochemical sweat sensor. These values are then converted to continuous time-varying signals using the interpolation methodology. Supervised machine learning, the decision tree regression algorithm, shows the goodness of fit R2 of 0.94 was achieved with an RMSE value of 0.1 mg/dL. The output of the model was tested on three human subject datasets. The results were able to capture the glucose progression trend correctly. Sweet sensor platform technology demonstrates a dynamic response over the physiological sweat glucose range of 1\u20134 mg/dL measured from 3 human subjects. The technology described in the manuscript shows promise for real-time biomarkers such as glucose reporting from passively expressed human eccrine sweat.",

Although millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been publicly shared in global databases, linkages with detailed clinical data are scarce. Therefore, we aimed to establish a COVID-19 patient dataset with linked clinical and viral genomic data to then examine associations between SARS-CoV-2 genomic signatures and clinical disease phenotypes. Methods A cohort of adult patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 11 participating healthcare institutions in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) were recruited from March 2020 to April 2022. Supervised machine learning (ML) models were developed to predict hospitalization using SARS-CoV-2 lineage-specific genomic signatures, patient demographics, symptoms, and pre-existing comorbidities. The relative importance of these features was then evaluated. Results Complete clinical data and viral whole genome level information were obtained from 617 patients, 50.4% of whom were hospitalized. Notably, inpatients were older with a mean age of 66.67 years (SD\u2009\u00b1\u200917.64 years), whereas outpatients had a mean age of 44.89 years (SD\u2009\u00b1\u200916.00 years). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analyses revealed that underlying vascular disease, underlying pulmonary disease, and fever were the most significant clinical features associated with hospitalization. In models built on the amino acid sequences of functional regions including spike, nucleocapsid, ORF3a, and ORF8 proteins, variants preceding the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) or pre-VOC variants, were associated with hospitalization. Conclusions Viral genomic features have limited utility in predicting hospitalization across SARS-CoV-2 diversity. Combining clinical and viral genomic datasets provides perspective on patient specific and virus-related factors that impact COVID-19 disease severity. Overall, clinical features had greater discriminatory power than viral genomic features in predicting hospitalization.

        "abstract": "Background and objective: Blood pressure (BP) is one of the crucial indicators that contains valuable medical information about cardiovascular activities. Developing photoplethysmography (PPG)-based cuffless BP estimation algorithms with enough robustness and accuracy is clinically useful in practice, due to its simplicity and noninvasiveness. In this paper, we have developed and tested two frameworks for arterial blood pressure (ABP) estimation at the central arteries using photoplethysmography and electrocardiogram. Methods: Supervised learning, as adapted by most studies regarding this topic, is introduced by comparing three machine learning algorithms. Features are extracted using semi-classical signal analysis (SCSA) tools. To further increase the accuracy of estimation, another BP estimation algorithm is presented. A single feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is utilized for BP regression with PPG features, which are extracted by SCSA and later used by FFNN as the network input. Both BP estimation algorithms perform robustly against MIMIC II database to guarantee statistical reliability. Results: We evaluated the performance against the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards, and we have compared the standard deviation (STD) of estimation error with current state of the arts. With the AAMI standard, the first method yields comparable performance against existing literature in the estimation of BP values. Regarding the BHS protocol, the second method achieves grade A in the estimation of BP values. Conclusion: We conclude that by using the PPG signal in combination with informative features from the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s spectrum, the BP can be non-invasively estimated in a reliable and accurate way. Furthermore, the proposed frameworks could potentially enable applications of cuffless estimation of the BP and development of mobile healthcare device.",

        "abstract": "The prevention and diagnosis of frailty syndrome (FS) in cardiac patients requires innovative systems to support medical personnel, patient adherence, and self-care behavior. To do so, modern medicine uses a supervised machine learning approach (ML) to study the psychosocial domains of frailty in cardiac patients with heart failure (HF). This study aimed to determine the absolute and relative diagnostic importance of the individual components of the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) questionnaire in patients with HF. An exploratory analysis was performed using machine learning algorithms and the permutation method to determine the absolute importance of frailty components in HF. Based on the TFI data, which contain physical and psychosocial components, machine learning models were built based on three algorithms: a decision tree, a random decision forest, and the AdaBoost Models classifier. The absolute weights were used to make pairwise comparisons between the variables and obtain relative diagnostic importance. The analysis of HF patients\u2019 responses showed that the psychological variable TFI20 diagnosing low mood was more diagnostically important than the variables from the physical domain: lack of strength in the hands and physical fatigue. The psychological variable TFI21 linked with agitation and irritability was diagnostically more important than all three physical variables considered: walking difficulties, lack of hand strength, and physical fatigue. In the case of the two remaining variables from the psychological domain (TFI19, TFI22), and for all variables from the social domain, the results do not allow for the rejection of the null hypothesis. From a long-term perspective, the ML based frailty approach can support healthcare professionals, including psychologists and social workers, in drawing their attention to the non-physical origins of HF.",

        "abstract": "In the healthcare industry, chronic disease prediction is crucial. It is crucial to diagnose the illness early. Large amounts of data are generated in computer science as a result of significant technological advancements. Many medical databases are created as clinical information networks advance. Data mining, the process of managing vast amounts of diverse data and extracting insights from it, has emerged as a crucial area of study. Early illness detection, patient treatment, and community services from huge data creation in the biomedical and healthcare communities are all benefited by the accurate analysis of medical data. Nowadays, one of the main areas of research is the management and extraction of knowledge from vast amounts of diverse data. Accurate processing of health data helps the biomedical and healthcare communities by improving patient care, early illness detection, and community services. However, analytical precision is reduced if medical data is not sufficiently consistent. For the domains of biomedical pattern recognition and master learning, the perception and diagnosis of chronic disease are guaranteed to be consistent. Additionally, the decision-making approach's goal is pushed. The study of high-dimensional, multi-modal biomedical data can be effectively addressed by machine learning. In computer science, chronic disease prediction is crucial. Early detection and prediction of chronic disease is crucial. The dataset for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is used for analysis by the suggested model. Using supervised machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Multiplayer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and XG boost, we provide a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease prediction system. Next, we examine classification techniques for predicting chronic diseases using a variety of criteria, such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, ROC, and AUC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Many patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) experience substantial delays in diagnosis, which is associated with worse outcomes and higher costs. Tools for diagnosing PAH sooner may lead to earlier treatment, which may delay disease progression and adverse outcomes including hospitalization and death. We developed a machine\u2010learning (ML) algorithm to identify patients at risk for PAH earlier in their symptom journey and distinguish them from patients with similar early symptoms not at risk for developing PAH. Our supervised ML model analyzed retrospective, de\u2010identified data from the US\u2010based Optum\u00ae Clinformatics\u00ae Data Mart claims database (January 2015 to December 2019). Propensity score matched PAH and non\u2010PAH (control) cohorts were established based on observed differences. Random forest models were used to classify patients as PAH or non\u2010PAH at diagnosis and at 6 months prediagnosis. The PAH and non\u2010PAH cohorts included 1339 and 4222 patients, respectively. At 6 months prediagnosis, the model performed well in distinguishing PAH and non\u2010PAH patients, with area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.84, recall (sensitivity) of 0.73, and precision of 0.50. Key features distinguishing PAH from non\u2010PAH cohorts were a longer time between first symptom and the prediagnosis model date (i.e., 6 months before diagnosis); more diagnostic and prescription claims, circulatory claims, and imaging procedures, leading to higher overall healthcare resource utilization; and more hospitalizations. Our model distinguishes between patients with and without PAH at 6 months before diagnosis and illustrates the feasibility of using routine claims data to identify patients at a population level who might benefit from PAH\u2010specific screening and/or earlier specialist referral.",

We created a feature selection pipeline to identify critical features between different datasets. Then a variety of unsupervised and supervised methods were used (eg, Sammon mapping and eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to train models on datasets of differing data quality, which reflects the varying availability and potential rarity of ground truth data in medical databases.\n\n\nResults\nResulting machine learning model accuracies ranged between 47.7% and 94.4% when tested on ground truth data. Finally, we found new features to help experts enhance existing case-finding algorithms.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDeveloping precise algorithms to detect medical outcomes in claims can be a laborious and expensive process, particularly for conditions presented and coded diversely. We found it beneficial to filter out highly potent codes used for data curation to identify underlying patterns and features. To improve rule-based algorithms where necessary, researchers could use model explainers to determine noteworthy features, which could then be shared with experts and included in the algorithm.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur work suggests machine learning models can perform at similar levels as a previously published expert case-finding algorithm, while also having the potential to improve performance or streamline algorithm construction processes by identifying new relevant features for algorithm construction.",

We aimed to develop supervised machine-learning algorithms on multiple digital metrics including symptom search trends, population mobility, and vaccination coverage to predict local-level COVID-19 growth rates in the UK. Using dynamic supervised machine-learning algorithms based on log-linear regression, we explored optimal models for 1-week, 2-week, and 3-week ahead prediction of COVID-19 growth rate at lower tier local authority level over time. Model performance was assessed by calculating mean squared error (MSE) of prospective prediction, and na\u00efve model and fixed-predictors model were used as reference models. We assessed real-time model performance for eight five-weeks-apart checkpoints between 1st March and 14th November 2021. We developed an online application (COVIDPredLTLA) that visualised the real-time predictions for the present week, and the next one and two weeks. Here we show that the median MSEs of the optimal models for 1-week, 2-week, and 3-week ahead prediction are 0.12 (IQR: 0.08\u20130.22), 0.29 (0.19\u20130.38), and 0.37 (0.25\u20130.47), respectively. Compared with na\u00efve models, the optimal models maintain increased accuracy (reducing MSE by a range of 21\u201335%), including May\u2013June 2021 when the delta variant spread across the UK. Compared with the fixed-predictors model, the advantage of dynamic models is observed after several iterations of update. With flexible data-driven predictors selection process, our dynamic modelling framework shows promises in predicting short-term changes in COVID-19 cases. The online application (COVIDPredLTLA) could assist decision-making for control measures and planning of healthcare capacity in future epidemic growths. Understanding how COVID-19 case numbers will change in the short term in local contexts is helpful for planning public health measures. Here, using population data on Google searches on COVID-19 symptoms, mobility (i.e., movement of people between locations), and vaccination coverage, we develop statistical methods that forecast changes in COVID-19 case numbers for the next one to three weeks in different local authorities in the UK. We further develop an online application that provides visualisations of these forecasts. We show that our programmes achieve better predictive accuracy compared with two existing models. This highlights the promise of our methods in forecasting future local COVID-19 outbreaks. Wang et al. predict local COVID-19 incidence one to three weeks ahead based on symptom search trends, population mobility, and vaccination coverage.

This study aims to identify patterns of symptoms and general rules regarding symptoms among patients using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The integration of a rule-based machine learning technique and classification methods is utilized to extend a prediction model. This study analyzes patient data that was available online through the Kaggle repository. After preprocessing the data and exploring descriptive statistics, the Apriori algorithm was applied to identify frequent symptoms and patterns in the discovered rules. Additionally, the study applied several machine learning models for predicting diseases, including stepwise regression, support vector machine, bootstrap forest, boosted trees, and neural-boosted methods. Several predictive machine learning models were applied to the dataset to predict diseases. It was discovered that the stepwise method for fitting outperformed all competitors in this study, as determined through cross-validation conducted for each model based on established criteria. Moreover, numerous significant decision rules were extracted in the study, which can streamline clinical applications without the need for additional expertise. These rules enable the prediction of relationships between symptoms and diseases, as well as between different diseases. Therefore, the results obtained in this study have the potential to improve the performance of prediction models. We can discover diseases symptoms and general rules using supervised and unsupervised machine learning for the dataset. Overall, the proposed algorithm can support not only healthcare professionals but also patients who face cost and time constraints in diagnosing and treating these diseases.",

Especially, health is one of the most important areas where machine learning studies are carried out successfully. The aim of this study is to develop models that predict the disease stage of people who apply to hospital with the diagnosis of Covid-19.\nInadequacies such as intensive care occupancy, insufficiency of beds, and shortage of respiratory equipment are among these problems, and this has left healthcare workers faced with the overwhelming burden of patients. Therefore, estimating the disease stages of Covid-19 patients at an early stage is of great importance. The data set used in the study includes the clinical and laboratory data of the patients during in their admission to the hospital.It has been tried to develop models that predict disease stage by using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms in the data set. The random forest model with 9 variables was the best performing model.\nWith the models obtained, it will be ensured that the hospital management receives information in order to see the necessary treatment for low-risk or high-risk patients and to avoid medical system inadequacies.",

        "abstract": "\n Background The use of machine learning techniques is increasing in healthcare which allows to estimate and predict health outcomes from large administrative data sets more efficiently. The main objective of this study was to develop a generic machine learning (ML) algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes based on the number of reimbursements over the last 2 years. Methods We selected a training data set from a population-based epidemiological cohort (i.e., CONSTANCES) linked with French National Health Database (i.e., SNDS) to develop a ML-algorithm for estimating the incidence of diabetes. To develop this algorithm, we adopted a supervised ML approach. Following steps were performed: i. selection of final data set, ii. target definition, iii. coding variables for a given window of time, iv. split final data into training and test data sets, v. variables selection, vi. training model, vii. validation of model with test data set and viii. selection of the model. Results The final data set used to develop the algorithm included 44,659 participants from CONSTANCES. Out of 3,468 variables, which were similar in SNDS and CONSTANCES cohort were coded, 23 variables were selected to train different algorithms. The final algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes was a Linear Discriminant Analysis model based on number of reimbursements of selected variables related to biological tests, drugs, medical acts and hospitalization without a procedure over the last two years. This algorithm has a sensitivity of 62%, a specificity of 67% and an accuracy of 67% [95% CI: 0.66 \u2013 0.68]. Conclusions Supervised ML is an innovative tool for the development of new methods to exploit large health administrative databases. In context of InfAct project, we have developed and applied the first time a generic ML-algorithm to estimate the incidence of diabetes for public health surveillance. The ML-algorithm we have developed, has a moderate performance. The next step is to apply this algorithm on SNDS to estimate the incidence of type 2 diabetes cases. More research is needed to apply various MLTs to estimate the incidence of various health conditions and to calculate the contribution of various risk factors on developing type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Social media sites, dubbed patient online reviews (POR), have been proposed as new methods for assessing patient satisfaction and monitoring quality of care. However, the unstructured nature of POR data derived from social media creates a number of challenges. The objectives of this research were to identify service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions automatically from hospital Facebook reviews using a machine learning classifier, and to examine their associations with patient dissatisfaction. From January 2017 to December 2019, empirical research was conducted in which POR were gathered from the official Facebook page of Malaysian public hospitals. To find SERVQUAL dimensions in POR, a machine learning topic classification utilising supervised learning was developed, and this study\u2019s objective was established using logistic regression analysis. It was discovered that 73.5% of patients were satisfied with the public hospital service, whereas 26.5% were dissatisfied. SERVQUAL dimensions identified were 13.2% reviews of tangible, 68.9% of reliability, 6.8% of responsiveness, 19.5% of assurance, and 64.3% of empathy. After controlling for hospital variables, all SERVQUAL dimensions except tangible and assurance were shown to be significantly related with patient dissatisfaction (reliability, p < 0.001; responsiveness, p = 0.016; and empathy, p < 0.001). Rural hospitals had a higher probability of patient dissatisfaction (p < 0.001). Therefore, POR, assisted by machine learning technologies, provided a pragmatic and feasible way for capturing patient perceptions of care quality and supplementing conventional patient satisfaction surveys. The findings offer critical information that will assist healthcare authorities in capitalising on POR by monitoring and evaluating the quality of services in real time.",

The availability and accessibility of diabetes datasets assists medical practitioners in the diagnosis process as well as researchers in various fields and these datasets are valuable sources. However, diabetes datasets are exposed to vagueness and uncertainty issues. This research work improved an interrelated decision-making model for diabetes by proposing a fuzzy rule-based model to handle the vagueness and uncertainty issues. The research methodology starts with pre-processing of the simulated diabetes diagnosis and level of care datasets that were validated by medical experts, as well as the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD). This is followed by the design of the fuzzy model and the construction of the fuzzy rules. Next, the testing of the fuzzy model using six supervised machine learning algorithms namely J48, Logistic, Naive Bayes Updateable, Random Tree, Bayes Net and AdaBoostM1. Lastly, the evaluation of the fuzzy model in terms of the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and confusion matrix. Experimental results show 100% accuracy for the diabetes diagnosis fuzzy model, for all the five machine learning algorithms mentioned except AdaBoostM1 with 79.8165% accuracy. In addition, for the level of care fuzzy model, the highest accuracy produced is 97.1098% for J48 algorithm and the lowest accuracy is 93.1049% for Naive Bayes Updateable and Bayes Net algorithms. Furthermore, for the PIDD fuzzy model, the highest accuracy obtained is 74.8698% for J48 and AdaBoostM1 algorithms and the lowest accuracy is 70.1823% for Random Tree algorithm. Overall, the proposed fuzzy model produced a good accuracy and working as expected associated to the previous interrelated decision-making model.",

        "abstract": "Thyroid disease is one of the most disturbing hormonal disorders faced by the global population. To help the healthcare industry to diagnose the disorder rapidly and accurately, supervised machine learning algorithms and feature selection were introduced to play an essential role in predicting whether a patient has developed thyroid disease from his/her various characteristics. Therefore, in this work, a new feature selection library was introduced, which was the Featurewiz in the Python library. The goals were to present the performance of the Featurewiz library and to decide on a remarkable model for thyroid disease prediction among several machine learning models, such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Nai\u0308ve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier, and ensembled machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boost). A data set consisting of records of thyroid patients in Australia was used to develop the machine-learning models. After the data set was cleaned, exploratory data analysis was carried out. The models were then built in two ways: without feature selection and with feature selection. The feature selection process was conducted by using a new Python library called Featurewiz. The performances of the models from the two operations were evaluated using three performance metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under Curve) value from ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve). From the two operations, the results are similar in the way that tree-based models, especially those formed by the ensemble method, outperform the statistical models. Initially, in the process without feature selection, the champion model is XGBoost with 99.23% accuracy, while Random Forest ranks second with 98.79% accuracy. However, after the feature selection, the result reveals that the champion model is Random Forest. This model achieves an improvement of 0.66% in accuracy (99.45%), making it the best model from both operations. The model also scores 0.99 and 0.97 in F1-score and AUC values, respectively. The valuable insights gained from this study can serve as a comprehensive framework for machine learning applications in predicting thyroid illness. Additionally, the study highlights the advantageous utilization of the Python feature selection library, Featurewiz. With the combination of Featurewiz and machine learning applications, medical authorities can save time and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis when identifying patients with thyroid disease.",

        "abstract": "The use of machine learning (ML) techniques in affective computing applications focuses on improving the user experience in emotion recognition. The collection of input data (e.g., physiological signals), together with expert annotations are part of the established standard supervised learning methodology used to train human emotion recognition models. However, these models generally require large amounts of labeled data, which is expensive and impractical in the healthcare context, in which data annotation requires even more expert knowledge. To address this problem, this paper explores the use of the self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm in the development of emotion recognition methods. This approach makes it possible to learn representations directly from unlabeled signals and subsequently use them to classify affective states. This paper presents the key concepts of emotions and how SSL methods can be applied to recognize affective states. We experimentally analyze and compare self-supervised and fully supervised training of a convolutional neural network designed to recognize emotions. The experimental results using three emotion datasets demonstrate that self-supervised representations can learn widely useful features that improve data efficiency, are widely transferable, are competitive when compared to their fully supervised counterparts, and do not require the data to be labeled for learning.",

This study analyzed seven violence-related subreddits to investigate the trends of different violence patterns from January 2018 to February 2022 to enhance the health-service providers\u2019 existing service or provide some new perspective for existing violence research. Specifically, we collected violence-related texts from Reddit using keyword searching and identified six major types with supervised machine learning classifiers: DV, IPV, physical violence, sexual violence, emotional violence, and nonspecific violence or others. The increase rate (IR) of each violence type was calculated and temporally compared in five phases of the pandemic. The phases include one pre-pandemic phase (Phase 0, the date before February 26, 2020) and four pandemic phases (Phases 1\u20134) with separation dates of June 17, 2020, September 7, 2020, and June 4, 2021. We found that the number of IPV-related posts increased most in the earliest phase; however, that for COVID-citing IPV was highest in the mid-pandemic phase. IRs for DV, IPV, and emotional violence also showed increases across all pandemic phases, with IRs of 26.9%, 58.8%, and 28.8%, respectively, from the pre-pandemic to the first pandemic phase. In the other three pandemic phases, all the IRs for these three types of violence were positive, though lower than the IRs in the first pandemic phase. The findings highlight the importance of identifying and providing help to those who suffer from such violent experiences and support the role of social media site monitoring as a means of informative surveillance for help-providing authorities and violence research groups.",

The processed data is then split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training set.\nThe model uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, and k-means clustering, to predict the likelihood of a patient developing diabetes. The model is evaluated on the testing set using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\nThe results show that ML-Diabetes is a reliable and accurate predictive model for the early detection of diabetes. The model achieves an accuracy of 85%, precision of 90%, recall of 80%, and F1-score of 85%. The model can be used by healthcare professionals to screen patients for diabetes and provide early interventions to prevent complications.",

According to some social study, lot of people spends their time on online searching of health related issues. By browsing they get lot of information about the medical concepts and health related issues. Normally, people use Google to search their queries and that search engine respond them with the answer but that answer is in scattered format. User does not gets the exact answer for their queries. From previous work there has been vital work on the information needs of health seekers in terms of questions and then select those that ask for possible disease of their manifested symptoms for further analytic. To resolve such issues an extensive experiment on a real-world dataset labelled by online doctor\u2019s show the significant performance. In this paper, we discussed the techniques for further restructuring of the question and answer has been done in order to get the exact answer of query. A tag mining framework for health seekers will be proposed; aim to identify discriminant features for each specific disease. In this paper we are going to use one of the most famous algorithm of machine learning that is decision tree. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. Surprisingly, it works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables. In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based on most significant attributes/ independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible.

        "title": "Predicting Successful Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation by Reduction in Positive End-expiratory Pressure Level Using Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Weaning patients from mechanical ventilation (MV) is a critical and resource intensive process in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) that impacts patient outcomes and healthcare expenses. Weaning methods vary widely among providers. Prolonged MV is associated with adverse events and higher healthcare expenses. Predicting weaning readiness is a non-trivial process in which the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), a crucial component of MV, has potential to be indicative but has not yet been used as the target. We aimed to predict successful weaning from mechanical ventilation by targeting changes in the PEEP-level using a supervised machine learning model. This retrospective study included 12,153 mechanically ventilated patients from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) and eICU collaborative research database (eICU-CRD). Two machine learning models (Extreme Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression) were developed using a continuous PEEP reduction as target. The data is splitted into 80% as training set and 20% as test set. The model\u2019s predictive performance was reported using 95% confidence interval (CI), based on evaluation metrics such as area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), F1-Score, Recall, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The model\u2019s descriptive performance was reported as the variable ranking using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) algorithm. The best model achieved an AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI 0.83\u20130.85) and an AUPRC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.67\u20130.70) in predicting successful weaning based on the PEEP reduction. The model demonstrated a Recall of 0.85 (95% CI 0.84\u20130.86), F1-score of 0.86 (95% CI 0.85\u20130.87), PPV of 0.87 (95% CI 0.86\u20130.88), and NPV of 0.64 (95% CI 0.63\u20130.66). Most of the variables that SHAP algorithm ranked to be important correspond with clinical intuition, such as duration of MV, oxygen saturation (SaO2), PEEP, and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) components. This study demonstrates the potential application of machine learning in predicting successful weaning from MV based on continuous PEEP reduction. The model\u2019s high PPV and moderate NPV suggest that it could be a useful tool to assist clinicians in making decisions regarding ventilator management.",

        "abstract": "- A novel method that combines the strengths of different classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is introduced in this paper. This method tackles the urgent need for cutting-edge diagnostic methods in the field of ophthalmology, mainly for the identification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The approach is ensemble-based. Classical methods in retinal analysis of images often fail as they are static and are unable to adjust to the unique details that each distinct image presents. This constraint results in less accurate and precise diagnostic results, highlighting the urgent need for more adaptable and dynamic methods. The suggested model differs significantly from previous methods. Through the use of an ensemble approach, it capitalizes on the distinct advantages of each classifier: the MLP process's sophisticated feature extraction skill, Naive Bayes' probabilistic analysis, and SVM's non-linear pattern recognition capacity. By combining these techniques, the inherent drawbacks of utilizing a single strategy are addressed, guaranteeing a more thorough examination of retinal samples and images. The core of this idea is the system using Deep Q Learning (DQL) for adaptive classifier selection. Using learned Q Values for various contexts, this reinforcement learning technique selects the best classifier adaptively for each unique retinal image, hence optimizing the ensemble. \nThis approach not only advances diagnosis accuracy and precision but also guarantees ongoing learning and adaptation to keep up with changing data patterns and advances in imaging technology. Extensive experiments on the IDRiD & EyePACS Dataset show the effectiveness of this model with a 5.5% increase in overall accuracy with other performance metrics, the results show a significant improvement over the current method. They represent a significant advancement in the timely and accurate identification of diabetic retinopathy, which will ultimately benefit patients and lessen the strain on healthcare systems. \nThus, this work represents a major step forward in patient care as well as a technological advance, opening the door to more efficient supervision and treatment of retinal illnesses.",

        "title": "Methods and computational techniques for predicting adherence to treatment: a scoping review",
        "abstract": "Background: Treatment non-adherence of patients stands as a major barrier to effectively manage chronic conditions. Treatment adherence can be described as the extent to which a patient's behavior of taking medications follows the agreed recommendations from the healthcare provider. However, non-adherent behavior is estimated to affect up to 50% of patients with chronic conditions, leading to poorer health outcomes among patients, higher rates of hospitalization, and increased mortality. In fact, 200.000 premature deaths each year in the European Union are related to non-adherence. A promising approach to understand adherence behavior of patients represent artificial intelligence and computational techniques. These techniques can be especially useful in analyzing large amounts of heterogeneous patient data, identifying both inter and intra-relationships between factors and patterns associated with non-adherence. Objective: This study offers a provision of a structured overview of the computational methods and techniques used to build predictive models of treatment adherence of patients. Methodology: A scoping review was conducted, and the following databases were searched to identify relevant publications: PubMed, IEEE and Web of Science. The screening of publications consisted of two steps. First, the hits obtained from the search were independently screened and selected using an open-source machine learning (ML)-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview, Active learning for Systematic Reviews. Publications selected for further review were those highly prioritized by ASReview. Results: 45 papers were selected into the second round of screening were reviewers performed the full-text screening. The final review included 29 papers.T he findings suggest supervised learning (regression and classification) to be the most used analytical approach. Over 54% of adherence topics being related to chronic metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Most assessed predictors were both treatment and socio-demographic and economic-related factors followed by condition-related factors. The selection of a particular computational technique was based on the research question, the type of data available and the desired outcome. A limitation of the reviewed studies is the lack of accountancy for interrelationships between different determinants of adherence behavior. Adherence behavior is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by multiple factors, and these factors likely interact with one another in complex ways. Conclusion: The creation of systems to accurately predict treatment adherence can pave the way for improved therapeutic outcomes, reduced healthcare costs and enabling personalized treatment plans. This paper can support understanding the efforts made in the field of modelling adherence-related factors. In particular, the results provide a structured overview of the computational methods and techniques used to build predictive models of treatment adherence of patients to guide future advancements in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Background Delayed breastfeeding initiation is a significant public health concern, and reducing the proportion of delayed breastfeeding initiation in East Africa is a key strategy for lowering the Child Mortality rate. However, there is limited evidence on this public health issue assessed using advanced models. Therefore, this study aimed to assess prediction of delayed initiation of breastfeeding initiation and associated factors among women with less than 2\u2009months of a child in East Africa using the machine learning approach. Methods A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset covering the years 2011 to 2021. Using statistical software (Python version 3.11), nine supervised machine learning algorithms were applied to a weighted sample of 31,640 women and assessed using performance measures. To pinpoint significant factors and predict delayed breastfeeding initiation in East Africa, this study also employed the most widely used outlines of Yufeng Guo\u2019s steps of supervised machine learning. Results The pooled prevalence of delayed breastfeeding initiation in East Africa was 31.33% with 95% CI (24.16\u201338.49). Delayed breastfeeding initiation was highest in Comoros and low in Burundi. Among the nine machine learning algorithms, the random forest model was fitted for this study. The association rule mining result revealed that home delivery, delivered by cesarean section, poor wealth status, poor access to media outlets, women aged between 35 and 49 years, and women who had distance problems accessing health facilities were associated with delayed breastfeeding initiation in East Africa. Conclusion The prevalence of delayed breastfeeding initiation was high. The findings highlight the multifaceted nature of breastfeeding practices and the need to consider socioeconomic, healthcare, and demographic variables when addressing breastfeeding initiation timelines in the region. Policymakers and stakeholders pay attention to the significant factors and we recommend targeted interventions to improve healthcare accessibility, enhance media outreach, and support women of lower socioeconomic status. These measures can encourage timely breastfeeding initiation and address the identified factors contributing to delays across the region.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Increasingly, research evidence is identifying subjective cognitive decline (SCD) as a precursor for cognitive impairment and dementia. Identifying predictors of SCD is essential for understanding its utility as a preclinical indicator for impairment and especially pertinent for Hispanics/Latinos who have limited access to healthcare resources and clinical diagnostics and are disproportionally affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias. We extend work on predictors of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in diverse Hispanics/Latinos in the US by modeling multidomain predictors of SCD. Method We use data (n = 4347, average baseline age = 56.4\u2010years) from the Hispanic Community Health Study/ Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL; 2008\u20102011; Visit 1), a multisite prospective cohort study of diverse Hispanics/Latinos, and its ancillary study, the SOL\u2010Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL\u2010INCA; average 7\u2010years after Visit 1). Our outcome is a composite SCD measured at SOL\u2010INCA by averaging the component items of the Everyday Cognition (ECog\u201012) scale and is modeled using 37 cross\u2010domain Visit 1 indicators, previously linked to MCI, reflecting (1) sociodemographic characteristics, (2) childhood factors, (3) acculturation factors, (4) biological and (5) behavioral markers, and (6) mental and (7) functional health factors. We use supervised machine learning (ML: Random Forest = RF; regression = ML\u2010Reg) and standard statistical techniques (regression = Reg) for identifying leading predictors of SCD. In secondary analysis, we assess enhancement in predictive performance by accounting for Visit 1 global cognitive (GC) function. Result Our best performing (i.e., R\u2010squared) ML model (ML\u2010Reg) explained only 17% of the variance in SCD. Leading identified predictors of SCD included physical health scores, airflow obstruction, anxiety, mental health scores, Hispanic/Latino heritage, education, depression, income, and language and social acculturation. GC was predictive of SCD and explained an additional 5% of the variance. Conclusion Our findings indicate that multidomain factors contribute to SCD prediction, but the explained variance was relatively low. Biological markers, previously linked to MCI in our cohort, played a less significant role. Notably, the fit of the ML models for SCD was low relative to MCI specific models in the same population. Follow\u2010up work investigates how incorporating contemporaneous measures of the factors (vs. baseline alone) may improve the predictive capacity of the ML models.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential to impact the healthcare industry, which is already on the road to change with the digital transformation of vast quantities of information. The implementation of AI has already achieved success in the domains of molecular chemistry and drug discoveries. The reduction in costs and in the time needed for experiments to predict the pharmacological activities of new molecules is a milestone in science. These successful applications of AI algorithms provide hope for a revolution in healthcare systems. A significant part of artificial intelligence is machine learning (ML), of which there are three main types\u2014supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In this review, the full scope of the AI workflow is presented, with explanations of the most-often-used ML algorithms and descriptions of performance metrics for both regression and classification. A brief introduction to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is provided, with examples of technologies that have developed for XAI. We review important AI implementations in cardiology for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning and natural language processing, emphasizing the used algorithm. Finally, we discuss the need to establish legal, ethical, and methodical requirements for the deployment of AI models in medicine.",

It considers both male and female groups, and the ratio varies by location. It is also used for the 25-69 age group. This isn't to say that people of all ages will be affected by heart disease. This condition could start in the early stages of life, and predicting the source and sickness is currently a huge challenge. Heart disease is one of the world's most fatal problems, one that cannot be seen with the naked eye and manifests itself as soon as it reaches its limits. As a result, precise diagnosis at the right moment is necessary. Every day, the health-care business generates massive amounts of patient and illness-related data. Researchers and practitioners, on the other hand, do not make appropriate use of this data. Despite its lack of knowledge, the healthcare business now has a wealth of data. In data mining and machine learning, there are a variety of approaches and tools for extracting usable information from databases and using that information to make more accurate diagnoses and decisions. So, in order to detect such disorders in time for adequate treatment, a reliable, precise, and feasible approach is required. In the realm of medicine, machine learning algorithms and approaches have been used to process enormous data sets. Researchers employ a variety of data mining and machine learning approaches to analyse large data sets and aid in the accurate prediction of cardiac illnesses. This research compares and contrasts the Nave Bayes, Help Vector Machine, Random Forest, and supervised learning models to find the most successful algorithm. When compared to other algorithms, Random Forest has95.08 per cent more precision.",

        "abstract": "The social and financial systems of many nations throughout the world are significantly impacted by life expectancy (LE) models. Numerous studies have pointed out the crucial effects that life expectancy projections will have on societal issues and the administration of the global healthcare system. The computation of life expectancy has primarily entailed building an ordinary life table. However, the life table is limited by its long duration, the assumption of homogeneity of cohorts and censoring. As a result, a robust and more accurate approach is inevitable. In this study, a supervised machine learning model for estimating life expectancy rates is developed. The model takes into consideration health, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics by using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to data from 193 UN member states. The effectiveness of the model\u2019s prediction is compared to that of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regressors utilized in earlier research. XGBoost attains an MAE and an RMSE of 1.554 and 2.402, respectively outperforming the RF and ANN models that achieved MAE and RMSE values of 7.938 and 11.304, and 3.86 and 5.002, respectively. The overall results of this study support XGBoost as a reliable and efficient model for estimating life expectancy. This work develops a model that takes into consideration health, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics in predicting life expectancy to address the limitations of traditional life expectancy models, such as the ordinary life table. The comparison of the effectiveness of the model\u2019s prediction with that of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regressors is performed. The reliability and efficiency of XGBoost in estimating life expectancy is assessed and established to be superior to Random Forest model, with implications to societal issues and global healthcare administration.

PTs can benefit by developing and training an LLM specifically for streamlining administrative tasks, connecting globally, and customizing treatments using LLMs. However, human touch and creativity remain invaluable. This paper urges PTs to engage in learning and shaping AI models by highlighting the need for ethical use and human supervision to address potential biases.

        "abstract": "Introduction Maternal mortality remains a critical global health issue, with ongoing efforts to reduce its incidence as part of international health priorities. Kenya, a sub-Saharan country that has a disproportionate number of maternal mortality is likely to miss this target unless evidence-based interventions are deployed. The paucity of reliable maternal health data calls for the development of alternative predictive models to complement the impaired civil registration system and the aperiodic national surveys. Methods We utilized DHS surveys from several Sub-Saharan African countries to estimate parameters for predicting Kenya\u2019s maternal mortality rate (MMR) in the absence of recent Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) data. We developed a multiple linear regression model using supervised machine learning using the R-programming suite. Our model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze regional trends and predict sub-national MMR variations. We then applied the model to predict MMR for Kenyan counties using the data for the KDHS 2022 survey. Results Using Pearson\u2019s correlation, we observed a significant positive correlation between MMR and total fertility (r = 0.32, p = 0.025) and a significant negative correlation between MMR and maternal age at first birth (r = -0.40, p = 0.005). Additionally, a significant correlation was observed with the cumulative percentage of mothers attending post-natal clinics, the prevalence of thinness (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), HIV infection in women (r = 0.20, p = 0.164), and physical violence during pregnancy. The model estimate of national MMR in 2022 was 367 deaths per 100,000 live births, ranging from 49 deaths per 100,000 live births in Kisii County to 1794 deaths per 100,000 live births in Turkana County. Conclusion Although MMR in Kenya displayed a general downward trend, our model\u2019s estimates for DHS 2022 indicate an increase compared to the 2019 National Census and Housing Survey estimate of 355 deaths per 100,000 live births. This rise may be attributed to COVID-19-related maternal deaths during the same period. The integration of predictive models to inform interventions and resource allocation could play a crucial role in enhancing maternal healthcare outcomes in Kenya.",

        "abstract": "An object-based cloud storage system is a storage platform where big data is managed through the internet and data is considered as an object. A smart storage system should be able to handle the big data variety property by recommending the storage space for each data type automatically. Machine learning can help make a storage system automatic. This article proposes a classification engine framework for this purpose by utilizing a machine learning strategy. A feature selection approach wrapped with a classifier is proposed to automatically predict the proper storage space for the incoming big data. It helps build an automatic storage space recommendation system for an object-based cloud storage platform. To find out a suitable combination of feature selection algorithms and classifiers for the proposed classification engine, a comparative study of different supervised feature selection algorithms (i.e., Fisher score, F-score, Lll21) from three categories (similarity, statistical, sparse learning) associated with various classifiers (i.e., SVM, K-NN, Neural Network) is performed. We illustrate our study using RSoS system as it provides a cloud storage platform for the healthcare data as experimental big data by considering its variety property. The experiments confirm that Lll21 feature selection combined with K-NN classifier provides better performance than the others.",

        "abstract": "With the growing unstructured data in healthcare and pharmaceutical, there has been a drastic adoption of natural language processing for generating actionable insights from text data sources. One of the key areas of our exploration is the Medical Information function within our organization. We receive a significant amount of medical information inquires in the form of unstructured text. An enterprise-level solution must deal with medical information interactions via multiple communication channels which are always nuanced with a variety of keywords and emotions that are unique to the pharmaceutical industry. There is a strong need for an effective solution to leverage the contextual knowledge of the medical information business along with digital tenants of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to build an automated and scalable process that generates real-time insights on conversation categories. The traditional supervised learning methods rely on a huge set of manually labeled training data and this dataset is difficult to attain due to high labeling costs. Thus, the solution is incomplete without its ability to self-learn and improve. This necessitates techniques to automatically build relevant training data using a weakly supervised approach from textual inquiries across consumers, healthcare professionals, sales, and service providers. The solution has two fundamental layers of NLP and machine learning. The first layer leverages heuristics and knowledgebase to identify the potential categories and build an annotated training data. The second layer, based on machine learning and deep learning, utilizes the training data generated using the heuristic approach for identifying categories and sub-categories associated with verbatim. Here, we present a novel approach harnessing the power of weakly supervised learning combined with multi-class classification for improved categorization of medical information inquiries.",

However, limited datasets in affective computing and healthcare research can lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding the ML model performance. This study employed supervised learning algorithms to classify stress and relaxation states using HRV measures. To account for limitations associated with small datasets, robust strategies were implemented based on methodological recommendations for ML with a limited dataset, including data segmentation, feature selection, and model evaluation. Our findings highlight that the random forest model achieved the best performance in distinguishing stress from non-stress states. Notably, it showed higher performance in identifying stress from relaxation (F1-score: 86.3%) compared to neutral states (F1-score: 65.8%). Additionally, the model demonstrated generalizability when tested on independent secondary datasets, showcasing its ability to distinguish between stress and relaxation states. While our performance metrics might be lower than some previous studies, this likely reflects our focus on robust methodologies to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of ML models, which are crucial for real-world applications with limited datasets.",

However, current machine learning algorithms that are trained using older adults and smaller datasets, may not perform well in practice for large populations. Aim To evaluate machine learning algorithms using large datasets accounting for both younger and older adults from multiple regions and diverse sociodemographics. Methods A large\u00a0dataset including 109,343 participants in a dietary-based colorectal cancer ase study from Canada, India, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States was collected by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This\u00a0global dietary database was augmented with other publicly accessible information from multiple\u00a0sources. Nine supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated\u00a0on the aggregated dataset. Results Both supervised and unsupervised models performed well in predicting CRC and non-CRC phenotypes. A prediction model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) was found to be the optimal algorithm with CRC misclassification of 1% and non-CRC misclassification of 3%. Conclusions ANN models trained on large heterogeneous datasets may be applicable for both younger and older adults. Such models provide a solid foundation for building effective clinical decision support systems assisting healthcare providers in dietary-related, non-invasive screening that can be applied in large studies. Using optimal algorithms coupled with high compliance to cancer screening is expected to significantly improve early diagnoses and boost the success rate of timely and appropriate cancer interventions.",

The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the role of AI in cardiovascular health care. Method: The methodology of this review paper involved an extensive literature review of the existing research on the topic of AI in cardiovascular health care. Result: Medical imaging is very important in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, but the interpretation of medical images is often time-consuming and subjective. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, have been developed to assist in the analysis and interpretation of data from medical imaging. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVM) are the two most frequently used AI algorithms in medical image analysis. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in cardiovascular healthcare have great potential to improve patient outcomes and lower costs. However, there are still some hurdles that need to be overcome such as integration with clinical workflows, model validation and generalization, and privacy and security issues related to patient data.

Seventy-eight and 96 kinematic parameters were measured from lower and upper limbs, respectively. Statistical and correlation analysis allowed to define four datasets that were used to train and test five supervised learning classifiers. Excellent discrimination between the two groups was obtained with all the classifiers (average accuracy ranging from 0.936 to 0.960) and all the datasets (average accuracy ranging from 0.953 to 0.966), over three conditions that included parameters derived from lower, upper or all limbs. The best performances (accuracy = 1.00) were obtained when classifying all the limbs with linear support vector machine (SVM) or gaussian SVM.

Due to the virus\u2019s contagiousness, the most powerful economies in the world are struggling with the inadequacies of resources. As the number of cases continues to rise and the healthcare industry is overwhelmed with the increasing needs of the infected population, there is a requirement to estimate the potential future number of cases using prediction methods. This paper leverages data-driven estimation methods such as linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) algorithm. All three algorithms are trained using the COVID-19 data of Pakistan from 24 February to 31 December 2020, wherein the daily resolution is integrated. Essentially, this paper postulates that, with the help of values of new positive cases, medical swabs, daily death, and daily new positive cases, it is possible to predict the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate future trends. Linear regression tends to oversimplify concepts in supervised learning and neglect practical challenges present in the real world, often cited as its primary disadvantage. In this paper, we use an enhanced random forest algorithm. It is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification. This algorithm works well for an extensive range of data items, and also it is very flexible and possesses very high accuracy. For higher accuracy, we have also implemented the XGBoost algorithm on the dataset. XGBoost is a newly introduced machine learning algorithm; this algorithm provides high accuracy of prediction models, and it is observed that it performs well in short-term prediction. This paper discusses various factors such as total COVID-19 cases, new cases per day, total COVID-19 related deaths, new deaths due to the COVID-19, the total number of recoveries, number of daily recoveries, and swabs through the proposed technique.

        "abstract": "Computer-aided decision support systems (DSSs) are becoming popular in a variety of professions. Notably, medical DSSs assist healthcare professionals (decision makers) choose the optimal course of action (decisions) while treating patients. Such systems help decision-makers in situations when there is uncertainty in manual decisions due to lack of information or expertise. Choosing a suitable learning algorithm in a DSS is essential and affects its performance. Among machine learning (ML) algorithms, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are considered the most suitable framework for many classification tasks. In healthcare, an ML-based prediction system/DSS employs data (genetic profile or clinical characteristics) and learning algorithms to forecast target values, which may give promising results. However, improving prediction accuracy is a crucial step in making informed decisions. One can apply various preprocessing methods (cross validation, feature selection, bagging, boosting, etc.) to achieve this. For complex classification tasks like cancer, decision-makers can utilize the hybridization of classifiers to increase prediction accuracy. The presented study investigates the possibilities of improvements in the design of hybridized systems for DSSs to assist healthcare professionals in robust decision-making before, during, and after cancer diagnosis. Since the network weights and the activation functions are the two crucial elements in the learning process of an ANN, this study is organized to investigates the improvement in the hybrid system by selecting suitable features from gene expression microarray data and using these features to compute the more realistic initial weights instead of using random guesses as initial weights for ANN. The use of the proposed framework gives promising results (upto 6.67% gain in accuracy when compared to previous study (Table-5) while 10.43% increase in accuracy when compared to conventional ML classifiers (Table-4).",

New developments in big data analysis tools, particularly those involving natural language, can be used to accurately and systematically evaluate the impact of the service. Objective: The study was intended to assess the predictive potential of eConsulta messages through different combinations of vector representation of text and machine learning algorithms and to evaluate their performance. Methodology: Twenty machine learning algorithms (based on five types of algorithms and four text representation techniques) were trained using a sample of 3559 messages (169,102 words) corresponding to 2268 teleconsultations (1.57 messages per teleconsultation) in order to predict the three variables of interest (avoiding the need for a face-to-face visit, increased demand and type of use of the teleconsultation).

In this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of refining these unspecific condition codes into more specific codes in a Dutch general practitioner (GP) EHR database by leveraging the available clinical free text. Methods: We utilized three approaches for text classification-search queries, semi-supervised learning, and supervised learning-to improve the specificity of ten unspecific International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-1) codes. Two text representations and three machine learning algorithms were evaluated for the (semi-)supervised models. Additionally, we measured the improvement achieved by the refinement process on all code occurrences in the database. Results: The classification models performed well for most codes. In general, no single classification approach consistently outperformed the others. However, there were variations in the relative performance of the classification approaches within each code and in the use of different text representations and machine learning algorithms. Class imbalance and limited training data affected the performance of the (semi-)supervised models, yet the simple search queries remained particularly effective. Ultimately, the developed models improved the specificity of over half of all the unspecific code occurrences in the database. Conclusions: Our findings show the feasibility of using information from clinical text to improve the specificity of unspecific condition codes in observational healthcare databases, even with a limited range of machine-learning techniques and modest annotated training sets. Future work could investigate transfer learning, integration of structured data, alternative semi-supervised methods, and validation of models across healthcare settings.

        "abstract": "Current environmental conditions and human lifestyles have resulted in the emergence of numerous diseases. The medical field generates an enormous amount of new data each year for remote monitoring of patients. Due to increased data growth in the medical and healthcare industries, accurate medical data analysis has been advantageous to early patient care. However, physicians often face challenges in accurately diagnosing diseases in patients far from hospitals. Therefore, utilizing remote patient systems (telemedicine systems) due to the complexities associated with their chronic conditions. On the other hand, predicting illness is also a challenging task. Thus, data extracted from heterogeneous, fast-flowing, and reliable sources is crucial for decision-making and disease prediction. This research paper aims to utilize supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict chronic diseases such as heart and hypertension based on the patient\u2019s features or symptoms by analyzing patient data collected by sensors and sources enabled by the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Supervised ML technology in Hadoop and Spark environments is employed to guarantee that this classification accurately identifies individuals with chronic illnesses. The methods are evaluated using 55,680 patient records to discover the proper match between the data set and the final disease-predicted result. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure employing the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm is 94% accurate, and DT outperforms the other four ML algorithms. This includes the Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Naive Bayes (NB) model, Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) in terms of both performance and accuracy metrics (precision, recall, and F-score).",

        "abstract": "Healthcare fraud is intentionally submitting false claims or producing misinterpretation of facts to obtain entitlement payments. Thus, it wastes healthcare financial resources and increases healthcare costs. Subsequently, fraud poses a substantial financial challenge. Therefore, supervised machine and deep learning analytics such as random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks are successfully used to detect healthcare insurance fraud. This study aims to develop a health model that automatically detects fraud from health insurance claims in Saudi Arabia. The model indicates the greatest contributing factor to fraud with optimal accuracy. The labeled imbalanced dataset used three supervised deep and machine learning methods. The dataset was obtained from three healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia. The applied models were random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. The SMOT technique was used to balance the dataset. Boruta object feature selection was applied to exclude insignificant features. Validation metrics were accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Random forest classifiers indicated policy type, education, and age as the most significant features with an accuracy of 98.21%, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, an F1 score of 99.03%, specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 90.00%. Logistic regression resulted in an accuracy of 80.36%, 97.62% precision, 80.39% recall, an F1 score of 88.17%, specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 80.20%. ANN revealed an accuracy of 94.64%, 98.00% precision, 96.08% recall, an F1 score of 97.03%, a specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 88.04%. This predictive analytics study applied three successful models, each of which yielded acceptable accuracy and validation metrics; however, further research on a larger dataset is advised.",

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) is a technology that can be used to analyze biological samples in a non-invasive manner. This study evaluated the use of NIR spectroscopy in the fingertip to detect neutropenia in solid-tumor oncologic patients. A total of 75 patients were enrolled in the study. Fingertip NIR spectra and complete blood counts were collected from each patient. The NIR spectra were pre-processed using Savitzky\u2013Golay smoothing and outlier detection. The pre-processed data were split into training/validation and test sets using the Kennard\u2013Stone method. A toolbox of supervised machine learning classification algorithms was applied to the training/validation set using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation regimen. The algorithms included linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM model performed best in the validation step, with 85% sensitivity, 89% negative predictive value (NPV), and 64% accuracy. The SVM model showed 67% sensitivity, 82% NPV, and 57% accuracy on the test set. These results suggest that NIR spectroscopy in the fingertip, combined with machine learning methods, can be used to detect neutropenia in solid-tumor oncology patients in a non-invasive and timely manner. This approach could help reduce exposure to invasive tests and prevent neutropenic patients from inadvertently undergoing chemotherapy.",

The proposed system introduces a novel supervised learning approach along with a novel feature extraction scheme which is more progressive and less iterative. The proposed system considers a case study to perform classification of breast cancer using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) where it is subjected to normalization first followed by a novel segmentation process that compliments the classification operation too.

        "abstract": "The world\u2019s population is increasing and so is the challenge on existing healthcare infrastructure to cope with the growing demand in medical diagnosis and evaluation. Although human experts are primarily tasked with the diagnosis of different medical conditions, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnoses have become considerably useful in recent times. One of the critical lung infections, which requires early diagnosis and subsequent treatment to reduce the mortality rate, is pneumonia. There are different methods for obtaining a pneumonia diagnosis; however, the adoption of chest X-rays is popular since it is non-invasive. The AI systems for a pneumonia diagnosis using chest X-rays are often built on supervised machine-learning (ML) models, which require labeled datasets for development. However, collecting labeled datasets is sometimes infeasible due to constraints such as human resources, cost, and time. As such, the problem that we address in this paper is the unsupervised classification of pneumonia using unsupervised ML models including the beta-variational convolutional autoencoder (\u03b2-VCAE) and other variants, such as convolutional autoencoders (CAE), denoising convolutional autoencoders (DCAE), and sparse convolutional autoencoders (SCAE). Namely, the pneumonia classification problem is cast into an anomaly detection to develop the aforementioned ML models. The experimental results show that pneumonia can be diagnosed with high recall, precision, f1-score, and f2-score using the proposed unsupervised models. In addition, we observe that the proposed models are competitive with the state-of-the-art models, which are trained on a labeled dataset.",

Updated plugins of K-mean and self-organizing map(SOM) machine learning algorithms were used to cluster the data class of mellitus type for initial clinical implications. The results of the K-mean assessment were built in 0.21 seconds with nine iterations for \u201ctype\u201d and eight for \u201cclass\u201d attributes. Out of 281 instances, 87 (30.97%) were classified as negative and 194 (69.03%) as positive in the testing on the Euclidean space plot. By assessment for Euclidean points, SOM discovered the search space in a more effective way, but K-mean positioning potencies are impulsive in convergence.

Glasberg et al., the multidisciplinary team of authors analyze risks and crises for healthcare providers and discuss the impact of cloud computing in such scenarios. \n \nThree contributions deal with specific healthcare-related use cases of cloud computing in diverse application scenarios. In \u201cSAMuS: service-oriented architecture for multisensor surveillance in smart homes,\u201d S. Van Hoecke et al. present the design of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for multisensor surveillance in smart homes. The solution is evaluated by building a smart Kinect sensor that is able to dynamically switch between IR and RGB and improves person detection by incorporating feedback from pressure sensors within the SOA. In \u201cA cloud-based X73 ubiquitous mobile healthcare system: design and implementation\u201d by Z. Ji et al., a ubiquitous mobile healthcare uHealth system is presented. It is based on the ISO/IEEE11073 personal health data (PHD) standards (X73) and cloud computing techniques. In \u201cAn expert fitness diagnosis system based on elastic cloud computing,\u201d K. C. Tseng et al. describe an expert diagnosis system based on cloud computing that is able to classify a user's fitness level based on supervised machine learning techniques. This system uses parameters such as user's physiological data, age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) and utilizes an elastic algorithm based on Poisson distribution to allocate computation resources dynamically. \n \nThe special issue editors would like to take this opportunity to thank the authors for their papers and the reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions.

        "abstract": "In the context of biomedical data, an anomaly could refer to a rare or new type of disease, an aberration from normal behavior, or an unexpected observation requiring immediate attention. The detection of anomalies in biomedical data has a direct impact on the health and safety of individuals. However, anomalous events are rare, diverse, and infrequent. Often, the collection of anomalous data may involve significant loss of human life and healthcare costs. Therefore, traditional supervised machine and deep learning algorithms may not be directly applicable to such problems. Biomedical data are often collected in the form of images, electronic health records, and time series. Typically, an autoencoder (AE) or its corresponding variant is trained on normal data, and an anomaly is identified as a significant deviation from these data based on reconstruction error or other metrics. An Ensemble of AEs (EoAEs) can serve as a robust approach for anomaly detection in biomedical data by combining diverse and accurate views of normal data. An EoAE can provide superior detection to a single encoder; however, its performance can depend on various factors, including the diversity of the created data, the accuracy of the individual AEs, and the combination of their outcomes. Herein, we perform a comprehensive narrative literature review on the use of EoAEs when using different types of biomedical data. Such an ensemble provides a promising approach for anomaly detection in biomedical data, offering the potential for performance improvement by leveraging the strengths of diverse AEs. However, several challenges remain, such as the need for data specification and determination of the optimal number of AEs in the ensemble. By addressing these challenges, researchers can enhance the effectiveness of EoAEs for anomaly detection in various types of biomedical data. Furthermore, through this review, we highlight the significance of evaluating and comparing the performance of an EoAE with that of single AEs by establishing agreed-upon evaluation metrics and investigating normalization techniques for anomaly scores. We conclude the review by presenting challenges and open questions in the field with for future research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has risen steadily, including a wide range of applications in the field of pharmacology. AI is now used throughout the entire continuum of pharmacology research and clinical practice and from early drug discovery to real-world data mining. The types of AI models used range from unsupervised clustering of drugs or patients aimed at identifying potential drug compounds or suitable patient populations, to supervised machine learning approaches to improve therapeutic drug monitoring. Additionally, natural language processing is increasingly used to mine electronic health records to obtain real-world data. In this mini-review, we discuss the basics of AI followed by an outline of its application in pharmacology research and clinical practice. Artificial intelligence is the upcoming technology in advance health care system. Current digitalization of medicine and availability of electronic health records (EHRs) has inspired clinical researchers and healthcare personnel to acquire artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies for big data analytics and for very large scale medical databases. The major advantage of AI is that it reduces the time that is needed for drug development and, in turn, it reduces the costs that are associated with drug development, enhances the returns on investment and may even cause a decrease in cost for the end user. A large number of researches are being carried out to improve the current available AI technology to make the pharmacy profession more efficient. The present article briefly describes the importance of AI in the process of drug development and then looks at the various AI tools that are available at the disposal of a modern-day pharmacist to aid in a more efficient functioning.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning uses artificial neural networks to recognize patterns and learn from them to make decisions. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the human brain. It uses machine learning methods such as supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised learning strategies to learn automatically in deep architectures and has gained much popularity due to its superior ability to learn from huge amounts of data. It was found that deep learning approaches can be used for big data analysis successfully. Applications include virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri, facial recognition, personalization, natural language processing, autonomous cars, automatic handwriting generation, news aggregation, the colorization of black and white images, the addition of sound to silent films, pixel restoration, and deep dreaming. As a review, this paper aims to categorically cover several widely used deep learning algorithms along with their architectures and their practical applications: backpropagation, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, capsnets, transformer, embeddings from language models, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, and attention in natural language processing. In addition, challenges of deep learning are also presented in this paper, such as AutoML-Zero, neural architecture search, evolutionary deep learning, and others. The pros and cons of these algorithms and their applications in healthcare are explored, alongside the future direction of this domain. This paper presents a review and a checkpoint to systemize the popular algorithms and to encourage further innovation regarding their applications. For new researchers in the field of deep learning, this review can help them to obtain many details about the advantages, disadvantages, applications, and working mechanisms of a number of deep learning algorithms. In addition, we introduce detailed information on how to apply several deep learning algorithms in healthcare, such as in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. By presenting many challenges of deep learning in one section, we hope to increase awareness of these challenges, and how they can be dealt with. This could also motivate researchers to find solutions for these challenges.",

Automatically categorizing images into predefined classes can significantly improve data management and decision-making processes. For this research, we investigate the effectiveness of two machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gradient Boosting, for image document classification. First, we preprocess the image data by extracting relevant features, such as Image Embedding, to create a feature vector for each image. These features are essential for representing the content of the images accurately. Next, we apply SVM, a robust supervised learning algorithm, to train a classification model. SVM aims to Determine the optimal hyperplane for effectively distinguishing the images into different classes while maximizing the margin. Furthermore, we explore the Gradient Boosting algorithm, an ensemble learning method combining multiple weak learners to create a robust classifier. We experimented with different classification results with ten classes. We employ Multiple measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, are used to assess the performance of the SVM and Gradient Boosting models.

However, accessing large labeled datasets is difficult in medical image analysis because of a shortage of medical experts, expensive annotations, and privacy constraints in the healthcare domain. Self-supervised learning is a branch of machine learning that exploits unlabeled data to encourage network weights toward a valid latent representation of the data during a so-called pretext task. The features learned by the model while solving pretext tasks are transferred to a downstream task where limited annotations are available. In this work, we propose PatchLoc, a novel pretext task whose objective is to find the location of a given patch from an image as a source of supervision. We validated the effectiveness of PatchLoc on a downstream segmentation task using three different medical datasets. PatchLoc yields substantial improvements compared to U-Net trained from scratch and other pretext task-based approaches in a low data regime.",

        "abstract": "Background Identifying patients at risk of dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is vital for effective healthcare delivery. This can be challenging in endemic settings because of high caseloads and limited resources. Machine learning models trained using clinical data could support decision-making in this context. Methods We developed supervised machine learning prediction models using pooled data from adult and paediatric patients hospitalised with dengue. Individuals from 5 prospective clinical studies in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam conducted between 12th April 2001 and 30th January 2018 were included. The outcome was onset of dengue shock syndrome during hospitalisation. Data underwent random stratified splitting at 80:20 ratio with the former used only for model development. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for hyperparameter optimisation and confidence intervals derived from percentile bootstrapping. Optimised models were evaluated against the hold-out set. Findings The final dataset included 4,131 patients (477 adults and 3,654 children). DSS was experienced by 222 (5.4%) of individuals. Predictors were age, sex, weight, day of illness at hospitalisation, indices of haematocrit and platelets over first 48 hours of admission and before the onset of DSS. An artificial neural network model (ANN) model had best performance with an area under receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76\u20130.85) in predicting DSS. When evaluated against the independent hold-out set this calibrated model exhibited an AUROC of 0.82, specificity of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.66, positive predictive value of 0.18 and negative predictive value of 0.98. Interpretation The study demonstrates additional insights can be obtained from basic healthcare data, when applied through a machine learning framework. The high negative predictive value could support interventions such as early discharge or ambulatory patient management in this population. Work is underway to incorporate these findings into an electronic clinical decision support system to guide individual patient management.",

Methods : First, we reviewed the blood stasis(BS) questionnaires of Korean, Chinese, and Japanese version to make a integrated BS questionnaire of patient-reported outcomes. Through a human subject research, patients-reported BS symptoms data were acquired. Next, experts decisions of 5 Korean medicine doctor were also acquired, and supervised learning models were developed using multiple logistic regression and decision tree. Results : Integrated BS questionnaire with 24 items was developed. Multiple logistic regression models with accuracy of 0.92(male) and 0.95(female) validated by 10-folds cross-validation were constructed. By decision tree modeling methods, male model with 8 decision node and female model with 6 decision node were made.

The WSN based IoT (WSN-IoT) design problems include network coverage and connectivity issues, energy consumption, bandwidth requirement, network lifetime maximization, communication protocols and state of the art infrastructure. In this paper, the authors propose machine learning methods as an optimization tool for regular WSN-IoT nodes deployed in smart city applications. As per the author\u2019s knowledge, this is the first in-depth literature survey of all ML techniques in the field of low power consumption WSN-IoT for smart cities. The results of this unique survey article show that the supervised learning algorithms have been most widely used (61%) as compared to reinforcement learning (27%) and unsupervised learning (12%) for smart city applications.",

On the other hand, machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical research and healthcare and are gradually improving clinical performance. \nUsing ML to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most critical areas of interest among the various applications of these new methods. The rise of antibiotic resistance and managing multidrug-resistant infections that are difficult to treat are important challenges. \nBoth supervised and unsupervised machine learning tools have been successfully used to predict early antibiotic resistance and thus support clinicians in selecting the appropriate treatment. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting antimicrobial resistance are among today's sciences. Therefore, an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) should be implemented to optimize antibiotic prescribing and limit AMR.",

This paper provides a new PSC mathematical cost model, which includes Blockchain technology (BT), that can improve the safety, performance, and transparency of medical information sharing in a healthcare system. We aim to estimate the costs of the BT-based PSC model, select algorithms with minimum prediction errors, and determine the cost components of the model. After the data generation, we applied four Supervised Learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine, and naive Bayes) combined with two Evolutionary Computation algorithms (ant colony optimization and the firefly algorithm). We also used the Feature Weighting approach to assign appropriate weights to all cost model components, revealing their importance. Four performance metrics were used to evaluate the cost model, and the total ranking score (TRS) was used to determine the most reliable predictive algorithms. Our findings show that the ACO-NB and FA-NB algorithms perform better than the other six algorithms in estimating the costs of the model with lower errors, whereas ACO-DT and FA-DT show the worst performance. The findings also indicate that the shortage cost, holding cost, and expired medication cost more strongly influence the cost model than other cost components.",

        "abstract": "Human feelings are fundamental to perceive the conduct and state of mind of an individual. A healthy emotional state is one significant highlight to improve personal satisfaction. On the other hand, bad emotional health can prompt social or psychological well-being issues. Recognizing or detecting feelings in online health care data gives important and helpful information regarding the emotional state of patients. To recognize or detection of patient\u2019s emotion against a specific disease using text from online sources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic detection of patient\u2019s emotions in healthcare data using supervised machine learning approaches. For this purpose, we created a new dataset named EmoHD, comprising of 4,202 text samples against eight disease classes and six emotion classes, gathered from different online resources. We used six different supervised machine learning models based on different feature engineering techniques. We also performed a detailed comparison of the chosen six machine learning algorithms using different feature vectors on our dataset. We achieved the highest 87% accuracy using MultiLayer Perceptron as compared to other state of the art models. Moreover, we use the emotional guidance scale to show that there is a link between negative emotion and psychological health issues. Our proposed work will be helpful to automatically detect a patient\u2019s emotion during disease and to avoid extreme acts like suicide, mental disorders, or psychological health issues.

Recent research studies have shown that Twitter data can be used for various purposes such as monitoring illnesses, promoting health, analyzing sentiment, and potentially aiding in medical directing. However, detecting fitness-related tweets in the vast amount of data on Twitter can be difficult. This pilot study, therefore, aimed to classify patient text about drugs and disease-associated tweets into meaningful health-related segments. The unlabeled dataset is divided into several groups using an unsupervised learning technique called K-Means Clustering, using this first label the text and followed by a combination of neural networks and machine learning classifiers, they classified 32046 diabetes-related tweets and 161290 drug text lines into five groups. Approximately 66.38% of drug line text was classified as health-related, with 55.14% \u201ctreatment and medication\u201d, 7.10% \u201cprevention\u201d and 4.14% \u201csymptoms and causes\u201d. Over 33% were categorized as \u201cOther and News\u201d. If we talk about the tweets as a dataset then the tweet was classified as health-related, with 44.30% \u201ctreatment and medication\u201d, 7% \u201cprevention\u201d and 5.3% \u201csymptoms and causes\u201d. Over 56.10% were categorized as \u201cOther and News. After this multiclass classification, we applied three machine learning and two deep learning models to find accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. Drug review was used as a dataset then SVM and LR models provided an accuracy of 98% and when tweets were used as a dataset then LR models provided an accuracy of 97%. This research shows the importance of social media data in the decision-making system in the healthcare domain.",

This scoping review appraised the use of multiple ML methods for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prediction. Search engines used were IEEE Xplore, JSTOR, PubMed, Sage, Scopus, Wiley, and WOS. Inclusion criteria included articles published within the past six years, open access and studies that focused on T2DM only. Out of 41 studies included, the most used ML method was Random Forest (n=33) and the most occurred best ML model (n=13). Customised Ensemble ML method adapted to the dataset was found to show the highest accuracy. However, there were insufficient study areas and samples in Southeast Asia countries, as there were differences in demographics and culture that affect the T2DM risk factors where computational resource and systems development were limited. We conclude ML methods can predict T2DM, from the system\u2019s perspective its intra-operability is viable for use in healthcare systems.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Since the advent of COVID-19, healthcare and IT cybersecurity have been an issue. Digital services and foreign labor have increased cyberattacks. July 2021 saw 260,642 phishing emails. 94% of 12 countries\u2019 employees experienced epidemic cyberattacks. Phishing attacks steal sensitive data from spam emails or legitimate websites for profit. Phishing spam uses URL, domain, page, and content variables. Simple machine-learning methods stop phishing emails. This study discusses phishing emails and patient data and healthcare employee accounts cybersecurity. This paper covers COVID-19 email and phishing detection. This article examines the message's URL, subject, email, and links. Uclassify classifies content, spam, and languages and automates emails. Semi-supervised machine learning dominates healthcare. The Uclassify algorithm used multinomial Naive Bayesian classifiers. Document class is [0\u20131]. This article compared Multinomial Naive Bayesian in two experiments with other algorithms. Experiment 1 achieved an MNB accuracy of 96% based on a database from Kaggle Phishing. Experiment 2 showed that the Multinomial Naive Bayesian system accurately predicted URL and hyperlink targets based on PhishTank data. 96.67% of respondents correctly identified URLs, and 91.6% did so for hyperlinks. These two experiments focused on Tokenization, Lemmatization, and Feature Extraction (FE) and contained an internal feature set (IFS) and an external feature set (EFS). MNB is more exact than earlier methods since it uses decimal digits and word frequency. MNB only takes binary inputs. MNB can detect phishing and spoofing.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that significantly impacts the mental, emotional, and social development of children. Early screening for ASD typically involves the use of a series of questionnaires. With answers to these questionnaires, healthcare professionals can identify whether a child is at risk for developing ASD and refer them for further evaluation and diagnosis. CHAT-23 is an effective and widely used screening test in China for the early screening of ASD, which contains 23 different kinds of questions. Methods We have collected clinical data from Wuxi, China. All the questions of CHAT-23 are regarded as different kinds of features for building machine learning models. We introduce machine learning methods into ASD screening, using the Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) feature selection method to analyze the most important questions among all 23 from the collected CHAT-23 questionnaires. Seven mainstream supervised machine learning models were built and experiments were conducted. Results Among the seven supervised machine learning models evaluated, the best-performing model achieved a sensitivity of 0.909 and a specificity of 0.922 when the number of features was reduced to 9. This demonstrates the model's ability to accurately identify children for ASD with high precision, even with a more concise set of features. Discussion Our study focuses on the health of Chinese children, introducing machine learning methods to provide more accurate and effective early screening tests for autism. This approach not only enhances the early detection of ASD but also helps in refining the CHAT-23 questionnaire by identifying the most relevant questions for the diagnosis process.",

Early detection of MCI associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD-MCI) and its biomarkers is critical to managing disability in PD patients, reducing caregiver burden and healthcare costs. Gait is considered a surrogate marker for cognitive decline in PD. However, gait kinematic and kinetic features in PD-MCI patients remain unknown. This study was designed to explore the difference in gait kinematics and kinetics during single-task and dual-task walking between PD patients with and without MCI. Kinematic and kinetic data of 90 PD patients were collected using 3D motion capture system. Differences in gait kinematic and kinetic gait features between groups were identified by using: first, univariate statistical analysis and then a supervised machine learning analysis. The findings of this study showed that the presence of MCI in PD patients is coupled with kinematic and kinetic deviations of gait cycle which may eventually identify two different phenotypes of the disease. Indeed, as shown by the demographical and clinical comparison between the two groups, PD-MCI patients were older and more impaired. Moreover, PD-MCI kinematic results showed that cognitive dysfunction coexists with more severe axial symptoms and an increase postural flexion. A lack of physiological distal-to-proximal shift in joint kinetics was evidenced in the PD phenotype associated with cognitive impairments.",

Therefore, this study aimed to use advanced supervised algorithms to predict the micronutrient intake status in Ethiopian children aged 6\u201323\u2009months. Methods A total weighted of 2,499 children aged 6\u201323\u2009months from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data set were utilized. The data underwent preprocessing, with 80% of the observations used for training and 20% for testing the model. Twelve machine learning algorithms were employed. To select best predictive model, their performance was assessed using different evaluation metrics in Python software. The Boruta algorithm was used to select the most relevant features. Besides, seven data balancing techniques and three hyper parameter tuning methods were employed. To determine the association between independent and targeted feature, association rule mining was conducted using the a priori algorithm in R software. Results According to the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, out of 2,499 weighted children aged 12\u201323\u2009months, 1,728 (69.15%) had MN intake. The random forest, catboost, and light gradient boosting algorithm outperformed in predicting MN intake status among all selected classifiers. Region, wealth index, place of delivery, mothers\u2019 occupation, child age, fathers\u2019 educational status, desire for more children, access to media exposure, religion, residence, and antenatal care (ANC) follow-up were the top attributes to predict MN intake. Association rule mining was identified the top seven best rules that most frequently associated with MN intake among children aged 6\u201323\u2009months in Ethiopia. Conclusion The random forest, catboost, and light gradient boosting algorithm achieved a highest performance and identifying the relevant predictors of MN intake. Therefore, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop targeted interventions to enhance the uptake of micronutrient supplementation among children. Customizing strategies based on identified association rules has the potential to improve child health outcomes and decrease the impact of micronutrient deficiencies in Ethiopia.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) in various sectors, including healthcare, smart cities, and industrial automation, has significantly enhanced operational efficiency and service delivery. However, this widespread adoption has introduced new vulnerabilities, making IoT networks a prime target for cyberattacks. Traditional security mechanisms often fall short in protecting IoT devices due to their limited computational resources and the unique nature of IoT network traffic. This paper introduces a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) that leverages network traffic profiling and machine learning techniques tailored for the IoT ecosystem. By analyzing the behavioral patterns of network traffic, the proposed system can accurately identify malicious activities and potential threats in real-time, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of IoT networks. The methodology encompasses data collection, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation stages, employing a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to optimize detection accuracy. Experimental results, conducted on real-world IoT network datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting a wide range of cyber threats with high precision and recall rates. This research contributes to the cybersecurity domain by providing a scalable, efficient, and adaptive IDS framework that can be integrated into various IoT infrastructures to mitigate the risk of cyber intrusions.",

        "abstract": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has significantly impacted healthcare, including sexually transmitted infection (STI) management in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), particularly among key populations (KPs) with limited access to health services. This review investigates 4IR technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), that assist in diagnosing, treating, and managing STIs across SSA. By leveraging affordable and accessible solutions, 4IR tools support KPs who are disproportionately affected by STIs. Following systematic review guidelines using Covidence, this study examined 20 relevant studies conducted across 20 SSA countries, with Ethiopia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe emerging as the most researched nations. All the studies reviewed used secondary data and favored supervised ML models, with random forest and XGBoost frequently demonstrating high performance. These tools assist in tracking access to services, predicting risks of STI/HIV, and developing models for community HIV clusters. While AI has enhanced the accuracy of diagnostics and the efficiency of management, several challenges persist, including ethical concerns, issues with data quality, and a lack of expertise in implementation. There are few real-world applications or pilot projects in SSA. Notably, most of the studies primarily focus on the development, validation, or technical evaluation of the ML methods rather than their practical application or implementation. As a result, the actual impact of these approaches on the point of care remains unclear. This review highlights the effectiveness of various AI and ML methods in managing HIV and STIs through detection, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. The study strengthens knowledge on the practical application of 4IR technologies in diagnosing, treating, and managing STIs across SSA. Understanding this has potential to improve sexual health outcomes, address gaps in STI diagnosis, and surpass the limitations of traditional syndromic management approaches.",

        "abstract": "Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition whose symptoms, severity, and progression over time vary enormously among individuals. Ideally, each person living with MS should be provided with an accurate prognosis at the time of diagnosis, precision in initial and subsequent treatment decisions, and improved timeliness in detecting the need to reassess treatment regimens. To manage these three components, discovering an accurate, objective measure of overall disease severity is essential. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can contribute to finding such a clinically useful biomarker of MS through their ability to search and analyze datasets about potential biomarkers at scale. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review to determine how, and in what way, ML has been applied to the study of MS biomarkers on data from sources other than magnetic resonance imaging. Methods Systematic searches through eight databases were conducted for literature published in 2014\u20132020 on MS and specified ML algorithms. Results Of the 1,\u00a0052 returned papers, 66 met the inclusion criteria. All included papers addressed developing classifiers for MS identification or measuring its progression, typically, using hold-out evaluation on subsets of fewer than 200 participants with MS. These classifiers focused on biomarkers of MS, ranging from those derived from omics and phenotypical data (34.5% clinical, 33.3% biological, 23.0% physiological, and 9.2% drug response). Algorithmic choices were dependent on both the amount of data available for supervised ML (91.5%; 49.2% classification and 42.3% regression) and the requirement to be able to justify the resulting decision-making principles in healthcare settings. Therefore, algorithms based on decision trees and support vector machines were commonly used, and the maximum average performance of 89.9% AUC was found in random forests comparing with other ML algorithms. Conclusions ML is applicable to determining how candidate biomarkers perform in the assessment of disease severity. However, applying ML research to develop decision aids to help clinicians optimize treatment strategies and analyze treatment responses in individual patients calls for creating appropriate data resources and shared experimental protocols. They should target proceeding from segregated classification of signals or natural language to both holistic analyses across data modalities and clinically-meaningful differentiation of disease.",

        "abstract": "\n Supervised machine learning requires the estimation of multiple parameters by using large amounts of labelled data. Getting labelled data generally requires a substantial allocation of resources in terms of both cost and time. In such scenarios, weak supervised learning techniques like data programming (DP) and active learning (AL) can be advantageous for time-series classification tasks. These paradigms can be used to assign data labels in an automated manner, and time-series classification can subsequently be carried out on the labelled data. This work proposes a novel framework titled active learning enhanced data programming (ActDP). It uses DP and AL for ECG classification using single-lead data. ECG classification is pivotal in cardiology and healthcare for diagnosing a broad spectrum of heart conditions and arrhythmias. To establish the usefulness of this proposed ActDP framework, the experiments have been conducted using the MIT-BIH dataset with 94,224 ECG beats. DP assigns a probabilistic label to each ECG beat using nine novel polar labelling functions and a generative model in this work. Further, AL improves the result of DP by replacing the labels for sampled ECG beats of a generative model with ground truth. Subsequently, a discriminative model is trained on these labels for each iteration. The experimental results show that by incorporating AL to DP in the ActDP framework, the accuracy of ECG classification strictly increases from 85.7 % to 97.34 % in 58 iterations. Comparatively, the proposed framework (ActDP) has demonstrated a higher classification accuracy of 97.34 % In contrast, DP with data augmentation (DA) achieves an accuracy of 92.2 %, while DP without DA results in an accuracy of 85.7 %, majority vote yields an accuracy of 50.2 %, and the generative model achieves an accuracy of only 66.5 %.",

However, as these traditional methods are based on human experience and implemented manually, there have been great limitations for general usability in current clinical practice. In this paper, a novel hybrid machine learning approach is proposed to identify melanoma for skin healthcare in various cases. The proposed approach consists of classic machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), EfficientNet, and XGBoost supervised machine learning. In the proposed approach, a deep learning model is trained directly from raw pixels and image labels for classification of skin lesions. Then, solely based on modeling of various features from patients, an XGBoost model is adopted to predict skin cancer. Following that, a diagnostic system which composed of the deep learning model and XGBoost model is developed to further improve the prediction efficiency and accuracy. Different from experience-based methods and solely image-based machine learning methods, the proposed approach is developed based on the theory of deep learning and feature engineering. Experiments show that the hybrid model outperforms single model like the traditional deep learning model or XGBoost model. Moreover, the data-driven-based characteristics can help the proposed approach develop a guideline for image analysis in other medical applications.",

        "abstract": "Over a century ago, Ivan P. Pavlov, in a classic experiment, demonstrated how dogs can learn to associate a ringing bell with food, thereby causing a ring to result in salivation. Today, however, it is rare to find the use of Pavlovian type associative learning for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Instead, other biologically-inspired learning concepts, in particular artificial neural networks (ANNs) have flourished, yielding extensive impact on a wide range of fields including finance, healthcare and transportation. However, learning in such \"conventional\" ANNs, in particular in the form of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are usually carried out using the backpropagation method, is computationally and energy intensive. Here we report the experimental demonstration of backpropagation-free learning, achieved using a single (or monadic) associative hardware element. This is realized on an integrated photonic platform using phase change materials combined with on-chip cascaded directional couplers. We link associative learning with supervised learning, based on their common goal of associating certain inputs with \"correct\" outputs. We then expand the concept to develop larger-scale supervised learning networks using our monadic Pavlovian photonic hardware, developing a distinct machine-learning framework based on single-element associations and, importantly, using backpropagation-free single-layer weight architectures to approach general learning tasks. Our approach not only significantly reduces the computational burden imposed by learning in conventional neural network approaches, thereby increasing speed and decreasing energy use during learning, but also offers higher bandwidth inherent to a photonic implementation, paving the way for future deployment of fast photonic artificially intelligent machines.",

        "abstract": "Physical performance tests aim to assess the physical abilities and mobility skills of individuals for various healthcare purposes. They are often driven by experts and usually performed at their practice, and therefore they are resource-intensive and time-demanding. For tests based on objective measurements (e.g., duration, repetitions), technology can be used to automate them, allowing the patients to perform the test themselves, more frequently and anywhere, while alleviating the expert from supervising the test. The well-known Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, typically used for mobility assessment, is an ideal candidate for automation, as inertial sensors (among others) can be deployed to detect the various movements constituting the test without expert supervision. To move from expert-led testing to self-administered testing, we present a mHealth system capable of automating the TUG test using a pocket-sized smartphone or a wrist smartwatch paired with a smartphone, where data from inertial sensors are used to detect the activities carried out by the patient while performing the test and compute their results in real time. All processing (i.e., data processing, machine learning-based activity inference, results calculation) takes place on the smartphone. The use of both devices to automate the TUG test was evaluated (w.r.t. accuracy, reliability and battery consumption) and mutually compared, and set off with a reference method, obtaining excellent Bland-Altman agreement results and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient reliability. Results also suggest that the smartwatch-based system performs better than the smartphone-based system.",

A field study using a prototype of the system was performed over four months with 39 volunteers. We obtained PC operation patterns using a PC logger, sleeping time and activity levels using a wrist-band-type activity tracker, and brain activity and behavior data during a working memory task using optical topography. We also administered two standard questionnaires: the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJS) and the Kessler 6 scale (K6). Supervised machine learning and cross validation were performed. The objective variables were mental scores obtained from the questionnaires and the explanatory variables were the biomarkers obtained from the modalities. Multiple linear regression models for mental scores were comprehensively searched and the optimum models were selected from 2,619,785 candidates. Each mental score estimated with each optimum model was well correlated with each mental score obtained with the questionnaire (correlation coefficient = 0.6\u20130.8) within a 24% of estimation error. Mental scores obtained by means of questionnaires have been in general use in mental health care for a while, so our multimodality system is potentially useful for mental healthcare due to the quantitative agreement on the mental scores estimated with biomarkers and the mental scores obtained with questionnaires.",

Therefore, healthcare institutions are seeking to develop integrated information-management environments to consolidate the inevitable application of big data to health care. There exist various entry points into the medical world where computational tools assist patient care matters; reporting results of tests, allowing direct entry of orders or patient information by clinicians, facilitating access to transcribed reports, and in some cases supporting telemedicine applications, because of disorganized and incomplete patient records pose an obstacle to patient care. The most common medium by which records of medical history are kept is paper making data management a severe impediment to productivity. However, the promise of a more efficient healthcare service is obvious through the use of automated health records management systems. Heart disease is a common disease that is overlooked by most.

We use this method to generate synthetic time series data that is composed of nested sequences using hidden Markov models and regression models which are initially trained on real datasets. We test our synthetic data generation technique on a real annotated smart home dataset. We use time series distance measures as a baseline to determine how realistic the generated data is compared to real data and demonstrate that SynSys produces more realistic data in terms of distance compared to random data generation, data from another home, and data from another time period. Finally, we apply our synthetic data generation technique to the problem of generating data when only a small amount of ground truth data is available. Using semi-supervised learning we demonstrate that SynSys is able to improve activity recognition accuracy compared to using the small amount of real data alone.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the global medical community has endeavored to provide swift and efficient patient care by leveraging real-time patient databases. However, the efficacy of these systems, particularly wireless body area network (WBAN) sensors, has been undermined by inaccurate and low-performance readings, leading to unnecessary alarm triggers. This study scrutinizes the potential of data dimensionality reduction techniques and machine learning algorithms in augmenting the detection accuracy of cardiac abnormalities in WBAN sensors. Dimensionality reduction was performed using principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and spatial correlation methods. For arrhythmia prediction, Decision Tree and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms were implemented and their performance compared. Numerical simulations and Python code analysis revealed that the application of data reduction techniques significantly improved the reliability and effectiveness of WBAN sensors in handling voluminous datasets. Furthermore, the use of PCA, ICA, and spatial correlation strategies notably reduced WBAN sensor battery energy consumption, data storage needs, computational complexity, and processing time. These pragmatic solutions could potentially empower healthcare practitioners to intervene proactively before patients encounter life-threatening conditions. The results also demonstrated that feature selection effectively eliminated irrelevant attributes from noisy Electrocardiograms (ECGs), thereby enhancing the precision of the analyses.",

        "abstract": "Identifying stress in older adults is a crucial field of research in health and well-being. This allows us to take timely preventive measures that can help save lives. That is why a nonobtrusive way of accurate and precise stress detection is necessary. Researchers have proposed many statistical measurements to associate stress with sensor readings from digital biomarkers. With the recent progress of Artificial Intelligence in the healthcare domain, the application of machine learning is showing promising results in stress detection. Still, the viability of machine learning for digital biomarkers of stress is under-explored. In this work, we first investigate the performance of a supervised machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) with manual feature engineering for stress detection with contextual information. The concentration of salivary cortisol was used as the golden standard here. Our framework categorizes stress into No Stress, Low Stress, and High Stress by analyzing digital biomarkers gathered from wearable sensors. We also provide a thorough knowledge of stress in older adults by combining physiological data obtained from wearable sensors with contextual clues from a stress protocol. Our context-aware machine learning model, using sensor fusion, achieved a macroaverage F-1 score of 0.937 and an accuracy of 92.48% in identifying three stress levels. We further extend our work to get rid of the burden of manual feature engineering. We explore Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based feature encoder and cortisol biomarkers to detect stress using contextual information. We provide an in-depth look at the CNN-based feature encoder, which effectively separates useful features from physiological inputs. Both of our proposed frameworks, i.e., Random Forest with engineered features and a Fully Connected Network with CNN-based features validate that the integration of digital biomarkers of stress can provide more insight into the stress response even without any self-reporting or caregiver labels. Our method with sensor fusion shows an accuracy and F-1 score of 83.7797% and 0.7552, respectively, without context and 96.7525% accuracy and 0.9745 F-1 score with context, which also constitutes a 4% increase in accuracy and a 0.4 increase in F-1 score from RF.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the predominant global cause of mortality, with both low and high temperatures increasing CVD-related mortalities. Climate change impacts human health directly through temperature fluctuations and indirectly via factors like disease vectors. Elevated and reduced temperatures have been linked to increases in CVD-related hospitalizations and mortality, with various studies worldwide confirming the significant health implications of temperature variations and air pollution on cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: A database of daily Emergency Room admissions at the Giovanni XIII Polyclinic in Bari (Southern Italy) was developed, spanning from 2013 to 2019, including weather and air quality data. A Random Forest (RF) supervised machine learning model was used to simulate the trend of hospital admissions for CVD. The Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) decomposition model separated the trend component, while cross-validation techniques were employed to prevent overfitting. Model performance was assessed using specific metrics and error analysis. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, a feature importance technique within the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework, was used to identify the feature importance. Results: An R2 of 0.97 and a Mean Absolute Error of 0.36 admissions were achieved by the model. Atmospheric pressure, minimum temperature, and carbon monoxide were found to collectively contribute about 74% to the model\u2019s predictive power, with atmospheric pressure being the dominant factor at 37%. Conclusions: This research underscores the significant influence of weather-climate variables on cardiovascular diseases. The identified key climate factors provide a practical framework for policymakers and healthcare professionals to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on CVD and devise preventive strategies.",

Machine learning and artificial intelligence have been employed by various healthcare providers, scientists, and clinicians in medical industries in the fight against COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption habit changes among healthcare workers in the United States during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. We utilize multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and models such as decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, Chi-Squared Test, mutual information, KModes clustering and the synthetic minority oversampling technique on a mental health survey data obtained from the University of Michigan Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research to investigate the links between COVID-19-related deleterious effects and changes in alcohol consumption habits among healthcare workers. Through the interpretation of the supervised and unsupervised methods, we have concluded that healthcare workers whose children stayed home during the first wave in the US consumed more alcohol. We also found that the work schedule changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic led to a change in alcohol use habits. Changes in food consumption, age, gender, geographical characteristics, changes in sleep habits, the amount of news consumption, and screen time are also important predictors of an increase in alcohol use among healthcare workers in the United States.",

Two stroke registers were used: the V\u00e4ststroke, a local register in Gothenburg, Sweden, and the Riksstroke, a Swedish national register. The reference variable, mRS (from V\u00e4ststroke), was mapped with seven self-reported questions from Riksstroke. The transformation algorithm was created as a result of manual mapping performed by healthcare professionals. A supervised machine learning method\u2014decision tree\u2014was used to further evaluate the transformation algorithm. Of 1145 patients, 54% were male, the mean age was 71 y. The mRS grades 0, 1 and 2 could not be distinguished as a result of manual mapping or by using the decision tree analysis. Thus, these grades were merged. With manual mapping, 78% of the patients were correctly classified, and the level of agreement was almost perfect, weighted Kappa (Kw) was 0.81. With the decision tree, 80% of the patients were correctly classified, and substantial agreement was achieved, Kw\u2009=\u20090.67. The self-reported outcomes from a stroke register can be transformed to the mRS. A mRS algorithm based on manual mapping might be useful for researchers using self-reported questionnaire data.",

        "abstract": "As the volume and complexity of data continue to grow, predictive analytics has emerged as a vital tool for extracting actionable insights from big data, driving decision-making across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. However, selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm for predictive analytics applications is challenging due to differences in algorithmic performance, computational requirements, and scalability, especially in the context of big data. This paper provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of popular machine learning algorithms utilized in predictive analytics, specifically focusing on their effectiveness and feasibility in big data environments.\nThe study categorizes algorithms based on learning types\u2014supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning\u2014and evaluates their performance across multiple dimensions: prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, scalability, and suitability for real-time analytics. Through a detailed analysis of algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and clustering techniques, we assess each method\u2019s strengths and limitations in handling large datasets. Additionally, the study introduces a series of metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score, and training time, as benchmarks for assessing the algorithms\u2019 predictive capabilities and computational viability.\nA hypothetical case study demonstrates the application of these algorithms on a sample big data set, providing insights into their real-world performance across different predictive analytics scenarios. Visual data representations, including comparative tables and performance graphs, offer a clearer perspective on the trade-offs among algorithm choices. The findings highlight that while certain algorithms like random forests and neural networks achieve higher accuracy in prediction tasks, they may also require substantial computational resources, posing limitations for real-time processing in big data applications.\nThis paper concludes with recommendations for selecting machine learning algorithms based on specific predictive analytics objectives, data characteristics, and processing requirements. Furthermore, it discusses the challenges associated with implementing these algorithms in big data contexts and explores potential advancements, such as the integration of deep learning and the use of distributed computing, as promising directions for enhancing predictive analytics performance in future applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Access to palliative care (PC) holds significance for hospital-admitted patients grappling with the symptoms of life limiting illnesses. Nonetheless, numerous such patients who could gain from PC fail to receive it promptly or even at all. We can leverage the prior year's historical data extracted from electronic health records of hospitalized patients to train a machine learning (ML) model. This model's purpose would be to prognosticate the requirement for PC consultation using real-time data. The model, operating as a semi-supervised system, will be integrated into institutional data pipelines, and utilized by a downstream display application overseen by the PC team. In cases where the PC team deems it suitable, a team member will communicate with the respective care team of the patient. The ML model's training efficacy will be assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) metric, employing a 20% reserved validation set. The threshold for PC consultations will be grounded in historical data. To enhance the ML model's precision, the pivotal variables within the model will be pinpointed, and any sources of biases or errors in the model will be identified for meticulous refinement. The AUC values of successive ML models will be juxtaposed with cross-validation data. Automatizing the referral procedure through electronic health record systems has the potential to usher in a more effective and streamlined approach to healthcare delivery.",

        "abstract": "In the last few years, cardiovascular diseases have emerged as one of the most common causes of deaths worldwide. The lifestyle changes, eating habits, working cultures etc, has significantly contributed to this alarming issue across the globe including the developed, underdeveloped and developing nations. Early detection of the initial signs of cardiovascular diseases and the continuous medical supervision can help in reducing rising number of patients and eventually the mortality rate. However with limited medical facilities and specialist doctors, it is difficult to continuously monitor the patients and provide consultations. Technological interventions are required to facilitate the patient monitoring and treatment. The healthcare data generated through various medical procedures and continuous patient monitoring can be utilized to develop efficient prediction models for cardiovascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular illnesses can aid in making decisions on life-style changes in high hazard sufferers and in turn lessen the complications, which may be an outstanding milestone inside the field of medicine. This paper studies some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction by using the medical data and historical information. The various techniques are discussed and a comparative analysis of the same is presented. This report compares five common strategies for predicting the chance of heart attack that have been published in the literature. KNN, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are some of the approaches used. Further, the paper also highlights the advantages and disadvantages of using the various techniques for developing the prediction models.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundA substantial proportion of microbiological screening in diagnostic laboratories is due to suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs), yet approximately two thirds of urine samples typically yield negative culture results. By reducing the number of query samples to be cultured and enabling diagnostic services to concentrate on those in which there are true microbial infections, a significant improvement in efficiency of the service is possible.MethodologyScreening process for urine samples prior to culture was modelled in a single clinical microbiology laboratory covering three hospitals and community services across Bristol and Bath, UK. Retrospective analysis of all urine microscopy, culture, and sensitivity reports over one year was used to compare two methods of classification: a heuristic model using a combination of white blood cell count and bacterial count, and a machine learning approach testing three algorithms (Random Forest, Neural Network, Extreme Gradient Boosting) whilst factoring in independent variables including demographics, historical urine culture results, and clinical details provided with the specimen.ResultsA total of 212,554 urine reports were analysed. Initial findings demonstrated the potential for using machine learning algorithms, which outperformed the heuristic model in terms of relative workload reduction achieved at a classification sensitivity >\u200995%. Upon further analysis of classification sensitivity of subpopulations, we concluded that samples from pregnant patients and children (age 11 or younger) require independent evaluation. First the removal of pregnant patients and children from the classification process was investigated but this diminished the workload reduction achieved. The optimal solution was found to be three Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms, trained independently for the classification of pregnant patients, children, and then all other patients. When combined, this system granted a relative workload reduction of 41% and a sensitivity of 95% for each of the stratified patient groups.ConclusionBased on the considerable time and cost savings achieved, without compromising the diagnostic performance, the heuristic model was successfully implemented in routine clinical practice in the diagnostic laboratory at Severn Pathology, Bristol. Our work shows the potential application of supervised machine learning models in improving service efficiency at a time when demand often surpasses resources of public healthcare providers.",

        "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the incidence of psychiatric disorders in the general population and an increase in the severity of symptoms in psychiatric patients have been reported. Anxiety and depression symptoms are the most commonly observed during large-scale dramatic events such as pandemics and wars, especially when these implicate an extended lockdown. The early detection of higher risk clinical and non-clinical individuals would help prevent the new onset and/or deterioration of these symptoms. This in turn would lead to the implementation of public policies aimed at protecting vulnerable populations during these dramatic contingencies, therefore optimising the effectiveness of interventions and saving the resources of national healthcare systems. We used a supervised machine learning method to identify the predictors of the severity of psychiatric symptoms during the Italian lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Via a case study, we applied this methodology to a small sample of healthy individuals, obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, and adjustment disorder patients. Our preliminary results show that our models were able to predict depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms during the lockdown with up to 92% accuracy based on demographic and clinical characteristics collected before the pandemic. The presented methodology may be used to predict the psychiatric prognosis of individuals under a large-scale lockdown and thus supporting the related clinical decisions.",

Following an unusual replication mechanism, its extreme ease of transmissivity has put many countries under lockdown. With the uncertainty of developing a cure/vaccine for the infection in the near future, the onus currently lies on healthcare infrastructure, policies, government activities, and behaviour of the people to contain the virus. This research uses exponential growth modelling studies to understand the spreading patterns of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and identifies countries that showed early signs of containment until March 26, 2020. Predictive supervised machine learning models are built using infrastructure, environment, policies, and infection\u2010related independent variables to predict early containment. COVID\u201019 infection data across 42 countries are used. Logistic regression results show a positive significant relationship between healthcare infrastructure and lockdown policies, and signs of early containment. Machine learning models based on logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machines are developed and show accuracies between 76.2% and 92.9% to predict early signs of infection containment. Other policies and the decisions taken by countries to contain the infection are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "There has been some improvement in the treatment of preterm infants, which has helped to increase their chance of survival. However, the rate of premature births is still globally increasing. As a result, this group of infants are most at risk of developing severe medical conditions that can affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, immune, central nervous, auditory and visual systems. In extreme cases, this can also lead to long-term conditions, such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, learning difficulties, including poor health and growth. In the US alone, the societal and economic cost of preterm births, in 2005, was estimated to be $26.2 billion, per annum. In the UK, this value was close to \u00a32.95 billion, in 2009. Many believe that a better understanding of why preterm births occur, and a strategic focus on prevention, will help to improve the health of children and reduce healthcare costs. At present, most methods of preterm birth prediction are subjective. However, a strong body of evidence suggests the analysis of uterine electrical signals (Electrohysterography), could provide a viable way of diagnosing true labour and predict preterm deliveries. Most Electrohysterography studies focus on true labour detection during the final seven days, before labour. The challenge is to utilise Electrohysterography techniques to predict preterm delivery earlier in the pregnancy. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies term and preterm records, using an open source dataset containing 300 records (38 preterm and 262 term). The synthetic minority oversampling technique is used to oversample the minority preterm class, and cross validation techniques, are used to evaluate the dataset against other similar studies. Our approach shows an improvement on existing studies with 96% sensitivity, 90% specificity, and a 95% area under the curve value with 8% global error using the polynomial classifier.",

        "title": "Machine Learning-Based Detection of Dengue from Blood Smear Images Utilizing Platelet and Lymphocyte Characteristics",
        "abstract": "Dengue fever, also known as break-bone fever, can be life-threatening. Caused by DENV, an RNA virus from the Flaviviridae family, dengue is currently a globally important public health problem. The clinical methods available for dengue diagnosis require skilled supervision. They are manual, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not affordable to common people. This paper describes a method that can support clinicians during dengue diagnosis. It is proposed to automate the peripheral blood smear (PBS) examination using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid dengue diagnosis. Nowadays, AI, especially Machine Learning (ML), is increasingly being explored for successful analyses in the biomedical field. Digital pathology coupled with AI holds great potential in developing healthcare services. The automation system developed incorporates a blob detection method to detect platelets and thrombocytopenia from the PBS images. The results achieved are clinically acceptable. Moreover, an ML-based technique is proposed to detect dengue from the images of PBS based on the lymphocyte nucleus. Ten features are extracted, including six morphological and four Gray Level Spatial Dependance Matrix (GLSDM) features, out of the lymphocyte nucleus of normal and dengue cases. Features are then subjected to various popular supervised classifiers built using a ten-fold cross-validation policy for automated dengue detection. Among all the classifiers, the best performance was achieved by Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), each with an accuracy of 93.62%. Furthermore, 1000 deep features extracted using pre-trained MobileNetV2 and 177 textural features extracted using Local binary pattern (LBP) from the lymphocyte nucleus are subjected to feature selection. The ReliefF selected 100 most significant features are then fed to the classifiers. The best performance was attained using an SVM classifier with 95.74% accuracy. With the obtained results, it is evident that this proposed approach can efficiently contribute as an adjuvant tool for diagnosing dengue from the digital microscopic images of PBS.",

The use of Predictive Analytic in conjunction with Machine Learning Techniques has been very promising in Healthcare, particularly in Cancer Prediction. The study tries to exhaustively examine a cancer prediction data set that would include the demographic details of a patient, their medical history, markers of genetics, and how lifestyle relates to the patient. The data set is prepared to allow the development of predictive models of identifying people who are most likely to develop any type of cancer. The data includes breast, lung, and colorectal cancers. It contains a wide variety of features, including clinical test results, imaging data, and genomics profiles, structured in such a way that would allow the insights from a variety of analyses, both supervised and unsupervised, and would look more directly into the correlations between a risk factor and cancer characteristics. Advanced machine learning algorithms, including random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning, enable researchers to build models that will predict - based on the past patterns of historical data - the probable possibility of cancer formation. This data set has immense opportunities for furthering personalized medicine, indicating individuals at risk early on for possible strategies in treatment. Moreover, the model's ability to predict the truth or accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevance metrics may be measured. The usage of this data set promotes open data use in cancer research, leading to a reduced number of cancers-related mortality and improvement of the accuracy of both prediction and early diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Robust and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) systems are essential to many human-centric services within active assisted living and healthcare facilities. Traditional HAR systems mostly leverage a single sensing modality (e.g., either wearable, vision, or radio frequency sensing) combined with machine learning techniques to recognize human activities. Such unimodal HAR systems do not cope well with real-time changes in the environment. To overcome this limitation, new HAR systems that incorporate multiple sensing modalities are needed. Multiple diverse sensors can provide more accurate and complete information resulting in better recognition of the performed activities. This article presents WiWeHAR\u2014a multimodal HAR system that uses combined Wi-Fi and wearable sensing modalities to simultaneously sense the performed activities. WiWeHAR makes use of standard Wi-Fi network interface cards to collect the channel state information (CSI) and a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer sensors to collect the user\u2019s local body movements. We compute the time-variant mean Doppler shift (MDS) from the processed CSI data and magnitude from the inertial data for each sensor of the IMU. Thereafter, we separately extract various time- and frequency-domain features from the magnitude data and the MDS. We apply feature-level fusion to combine the extracted features, and finally supervised learning techniques are used to recognize the performed activities. We evaluate the performance of WiWeHAR by using a multimodal human activity data set, which was obtained from 9 participants. Each participant carried out four activities, such as walking, falling, sitting, and picking up an object from the floor. Our results indicate that the proposed multimodal WiWeHAR system outperforms the unimodal CSI, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer HAR systems and achieves an overall recognition accuracy of 99.6%\u2013100%.",

However, several barriers remain in China due to a lack of professional HPC providers with positive behavioral intentions. Therefore, we conducted an original study introducing machine learning to explore individual behavioral intentions and detect factors of enablers of, and barriers to, excavating potential human resources and improving HPC accessibility. Methods A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate healthcare providers' behavioral intentions, knowledge, attitudes, and practices in hospice care (KAPHC) with an indigenized KAPHC scale. Binary Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) were performed to model impacting and predict individual behavioral intentions. Results The RFC showed high sensitivity (accuracy = 0.75; F1 score = 0.84; recall = 0.94). Attitude could directly or indirectly improve work enthusiasm and is the most efficient approach to reveal behavioral intentions. Continuous practice could also improve individual confidence and willingness to provide HPC. In addition, scientific knowledge and related skills were the foundation of implementing HPC. Conclusion Individual behavioral intention is crucial for improving HPC accessibility, particularly at the initial stage. A well-trained RFC can help estimate individual behavioral intentions to organize a productive team and promote additional policies.",

Most of them affect children, are chronic and progressive, and have no specific treatment. RD patients face diagnostic challenges, with an average diagnosis time of 5 years, multiple specialist visits, and invasive procedures. This \u2018diagnostic odyssey\u2019 can be detrimental to their health. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to improve healthcare by providing more personalized and accurate patient management, diagnoses, and in some cases, treatments. Leveraging the MIMIC-III database and additional medical notes from different sources such as in-house data, PubMed and chatGPT, we propose a labeled dataset for early RD detection in hospital settings. Applying various supervised ML methods, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machine (SVM), deep learning methods (LSTM and CNN), and Transformers (BERT), we validated the use of the proposed resource, achieving 92.7% F-measure and a 96% AUC using SVM. These findings highlight the potential of ML in redirecting RD patients towards more accurate diagnostic pathways and presents a corpus that can be used for future development and refinements.

As a result, smart healthcare applications have been and are being developed to provide, using mobile and electronic technology, higher diagnosis quality of the diseases, better treatment of the patients, and improved quality of lives. Since smart healthcare applications that are mainly concerned with the prediction of healthcare data (like diseases for example) rely on predictive healthcare data analytics, it is imperative for such predictive healthcare data analytics to be as accurate as possible. In this paper, we will exploit supervised machine learning methods in classification and regression to improve the performance of the traditional Random Forest on healthcare datasets, both in terms of accuracy and classification/regression speed, in order to produce an effective and efficient smart healthcare application, which we have termed eGAP. eGAP uses the evolutionary game theoretic approach replicator dynamics to evolve a Random Forest ensemble. Trees of high resemblance in an initial Random Forest are clustered, and then clusters grow and shrink by adding and removing trees using replicator dynamics, according to the predictive accuracy of each subforest represented by a cluster of trees. All clusters have an initial number of trees that is equal to the number of trees in the smallest cluster. Cluster growth is performed using trees that are not initially sampled. The speed and accuracy of the proposed method have been demonstrated by an experimental study on 10 classification and 10 regression medical datasets.",

        "abstract": "The scope of this work is to build a Machine Learning model able to predict patients risk to contract a multidrug resistant urinary tract infection (MDR UTI) after hospitalization. To achieve this goal, we used different popular Machine Learning tools. Moreover, we integrated an easy-to-use cloud platform, called DSaaS (Data Science as a Service), well suited for hospital structures, where healthcare operators might not have specific competences in using programming languages but still, they do need to analyze data as a continuous process. Moreover, DSaaS allows the validation of data analysis models based on supervised Machine Learning regression and classification algorithms. We used DSaaS on a real antibiotic stewardship dataset to make predictions about antibiotic resistance in the Clinical Pathology Operative Unit of the Principe di Piemonte Hospital in Senigallia, Marche, Italy. Data related to a total of 1486 hospitalized patients with nosocomial urinary tract infection (UTI). Sex, age, age class, ward and time period, were used to predict the onset of a MDR UTI. Machine Learning methods such as Catboost, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks were utilized to build predictive models. Among the performance evaluators, already implemented in DSaaS, we used accuracy (ACC), area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), area under Precision-Recall curve (AUC-PRC), F1 score, sensitivity (SEN), specificity and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Catboost exhibited the best predictive results (MCC 0.909; SEN 0.904; F1 score 0.809; AUC-PRC 0.853, AUC-ROC 0.739; ACC 0.717) with the highest value in every metric. the predictive model built with DSaaS may serve as a useful support tool for physicians treating hospitalized patients with a high risk to acquire MDR UTIs. We obtained these results using only five easy and fast predictors accessible for each patient hospitalization. In future, DSaaS will be enriched with more features like unsupervised Machine Learning techniques, streaming data analysis, distributed calculation and big data storage and management to allow researchers to perform a complete data analysis pipeline. The DSaaS prototype is available as a demo at the following address: https://dsaas-demo.shinyapps.io/Server/",

The present paper provides a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. Moreover, the paper attempts to determine the accurate clusters of similar industries in United States that collectively account for more than 85 percent of economy\u2019s aggregate export and import flows over the period 2002 - 2021 through clustering algorithm (unsupervised learning). Four clusters of mapping labels have been used, namely the low investment (LL), category 1 medium investment (HL), category 2 medium investment (LH) and high investment (HH). The empirical results indicate that machinery and electrical equipment is classified as a high investment sector due to its efficient production mechanism. The analysis further underlines the need for upstream value chain integration through skill - augmentation and innovation especially in low investment industries. Overall, this paper aims to explain the trends of ML approaches and their applicability in various real - world domains, as well as serve as a reference point for academia",

        "abstract": "Objectives Unstructured free-text patient feedback contains rich information, and analysing these data manually would require a lot of personnel resources which are not available in most healthcare organisations.To undertake a systematic review of the literature on the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to process and analyse free-text patient experience data. Methods Databases were systematically searched to identify articles published between January 2000 and December 2019 examining NLP to analyse free-text patient feedback. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the studies, a narrative synthesis was deemed most appropriate. Data related to the study purpose, corpus, methodology, performance metrics and indicators of quality were recorded. Results Nineteen articles were included. The majority (80%) of studies applied language analysis techniques on patient feedback from social media sites (unsolicited) followed by structured surveys (solicited). Supervised learning was frequently used (n=9), followed by unsupervised (n=6) and semisupervised (n=3). Comments extracted from social media were analysed using an unsupervised approach, and free-text comments held within structured surveys were analysed using a supervised approach. Reported performance metrics included the precision, recall and F-measure, with support vector machine and Na\u00efve Bayes being the best performing ML classifiers. Conclusion NLP and ML have emerged as an important tool for processing unstructured free text. Both supervised and unsupervised approaches have their role depending on the data source. With the advancement of data analysis tools, these techniques may be useful to healthcare organisations to generate insight from the volumes of unstructured free-text data.",

        "abstract": ": The innovation in technologies related to health facilities today is increasingly helping to manage patients with different diseases. The most fatal of these is the issue of heart disease that cannot be detected from a naked eye, and attacks as soon as the human exceeds the allowed range of vital signs like pulse rate, body temperature, and blood pressure. The real challenge is to diagnose patients with more diagnostic accuracy and in a timely manner, followed by prescribing appropriate treatments and keeping prescription errors to a minimum. In developing countries, the domain of healthcare is progressing day by day using different Smart healthcare: emerging technologies like cloud computing, fog computing, and mobile computing. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used to manage the huge volume of data using cloud computing. That reduces the storage, processing, and retrieval cost as well as ensuring the availability of data. Machine learning procedures are used to extract hidden patterns and data analytics. In this research, a combination of cloud computing and machine learning algorithm Support vector machine (SVM) is used to predict heart diseases. Simulation results have shown that the proposed intelligent cloud-based heart disease prediction system empowered with a Support vector machine (SVM)-based system model gives 93.33% accuracy, which is better than previously published approaches.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic data provides a privacy protecting mechanism for the broad usage and sharing of healthcare data for secondary purposes. It is considered a safe approach for the sharing of sensitive data as it generates an artificial dataset that contains no identifiable information. Synthetic data is increasing in popularity with multiple synthetic data generators developed in the past decade, yet its utility is still a subject of research. This paper is concerned with evaluating the effect of various synthetic data generation and usage settings on the utility of the generated synthetic data and its derived models. Specifically, we investigate (i) the effect of data pre-processing on the utility of the synthetic data generated, (ii) whether tuning should be applied to the synthetic datasets when generating supervised machine learning models, and (iii) whether sharing preliminary machine learning results can improve the synthetic data models. Lastly, (iv) we investigate whether one utility measure (Propensity score) can predict the accuracy of the machine learning models generated from the synthetic data when employed in real life. We use two popular measures of synthetic data utility, propensity score and classification accuracy, to compare the different settings. We adopt a recent mechanism for the calculation of propensity, which looks carefully into the choice of model for the propensity score calculation. Accordingly, this paper takes a new direction with investigating the effect of various data generation and usage settings on the quality of the generated data and its ensuing models. The goal is to inform on the best strategies to follow when generating and using synthetic data.",

        "abstract": "Drug\u2013drug interactions (DDI) are a critical concern in healthcare due to their potential to cause adverse effects and compromise patient safety. Supervised machine learning models for DDI prediction need to be optimized to learn abstract, transferable features, and generalize to larger chemical spaces, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality labeled DDI data. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we present SMR\u2013DDI, a self-supervised framework that leverages contrastive learning to embed drugs into a scaffold-based feature space. Molecular scaffolds represent the core structural motifs that drive pharmacological activities, making them valuable for learning informative representations. Specifically, we pre-trained SMR\u2013DDI on a large-scale unlabeled molecular dataset. We generated augmented views for each molecule via SMILES enumeration and optimized the embedding process through contrastive loss minimization between views. This enables the model to capture relevant and robust molecular features while reducing noise. We then transfer the learned representations for the downstream prediction of DDI. Experiments show that the new feature space has comparable expressivity to state-of-the-art molecular representations and achieved competitive DDI prediction results while training on less data. Additional investigations also revealed that pre-training on more extensive and diverse unlabeled molecular datasets improved the model\u2019s capability to embed molecules more effectively. Our results highlight contrastive learning as a promising approach for DDI prediction that can identify potentially hazardous drug combinations using only structural information.",

        "abstract": "Background Snakebite envenoming is a serious condition that affects 2.5 million people and causes 81,000\u2013138,000 deaths every year, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The World Health Organization has set a goal to halve the deaths and disabilities related to snakebite envenoming by 2030. However, significant challenges in achieving this goal include a lack of robust research evidence related to snakebite incidence and treatment, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to combine established methodologies with the latest tools in Artificial Intelligence to assess the barriers to effective snakebite treatment in Ghana. Method We used a MaxDiff statistical experiment design to collect data, and six supervised machine learning models were applied to predict responses whose performance showed an advantage over the other through 6921 data points partitioned using the hold-back validation method, with 70% training and 30% validation. The results were compared using key metrics: Akaike Information Criterion corrected, Bayesian Information Criterion, Root Average Squared Error, and Fit Time in milliseconds. Results Considering all the responses, none of the six machine learning algorithms proved superior, but the Generalized Regression Model (Ridge) performed consistently better among the candidate models. The model consistently predicted several key significant barriers to effective snakebite treatment, such as the high cost of antivenoms, increased use of unorthodox, harmful practices, lack of access to effective antivenoms in remote areas when needed, and resorting to unorthodox and harmful practices in addition to hospital treatment. Conclusion The combination of a MaxDiff statistical experiment design to collect data and six machine learning models allowed the identification of barriers to accessing effective therapies for snakebite envenoming in Ghana. Addressing these barriers through targeted policy interventions, including intensified advocacy, continuous education, community engagement, healthcare worker training, and strategic investments, can enhance the effectiveness of snakebite treatment, ultimately benefiting snakebite victims and reducing the burden of snakebite envenoming. There is a need for robust regulatory frameworks and increased antivenom production to address these barriers.",

        "abstract": "The Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud services, web-based software systems, and other wireless sensor devices in the healthcare infrastructure have led to phenomenal improvements and benefits in the healthcare sector. Digital healthcare has ensured early diagnosis of the diseases, greater accessibility, and mass outreach in terms of treatment. Despite this unprecedented success, the privacy and confidentiality of the healthcare data have become a major concern for all the stakeholders. Data breach reports reveal that the healthcare data industry is one of the key targets of cyber invaders. In fact the last few years have registered an unprecedented rise in healthcare data breaches. Hacking incidents and privilege abuse are the most common threats and have exposed sensitive and protected health data. Experts and researchers are working on various techniques, tools, and methods to address the security issues related to healthcare data. In this article, the main focus is on evaluating the impact of research studies done in the context of healthcare data breach reports to identify the contemporary privacy and confidentiality issues of sensitive healthcare data. Analysis of the research studies depicts that there is a need for proactive security mechanisms that will help the healthcare organizations to identify abnormal user behavior while accessing healthcare data. Moreover, studies also suggest that ML techniques would be highly effective in securing the privacy and confidentiality of the healthcare data. Working further on this premise, the present study also proposes a conceptual framework that will secure the privacy and confidentiality of healthcare data proactively. The proposed framework is based on ML techniques to detect deviated user access against Electronic Health Records. Further, fuzzy-based Analytical Network Process (ANP), a multi-criteria decision-making approach, is used to assess the accuracy of the supervised and unsupervised ML approaches for achieving a dynamic digital healthcare data security environment.

This study assesses the combined efficacy of two data reduction techniques: Random Undersampling (RUS), and a novel ensemble supervised feature selection method. The techniques are applied to optimize Machine Learning models for fraud identification in the classification of highly imbalanced Big Medicare Data. Utilizing two datasets from The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) labeled by the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), our principal contribution lies in empirically demonstrating that data reduction techniques applied to these datasets significantly improves classification performance. The study employs a systematic experimental design to investigate various scenarios, ranging from using each technique in isolation to employing them in combination. The results indicate that a synergistic application of both techniques outperforms models that utilize all available features and data. Moreover, reduction in the number of features leads to more explainable models.

The objective of this work was to assess the content of family physicians\u2019 electronic medical records and characterize the quality of the documentation of sociodemographic characteristics. Descriptive statistics were reported for each sociodemographic characteristic. The association between the completeness rates of the sociodemographic data and the various clinics, electronic medical record vendors, and physician characteristics was analyzed. Supervised machine learning models were used to determine the absence or presence of each characteristic for all adult patients over the age of 18 in the database. Documentation of marital status (51.0%) and occupation (47.2%) were significantly higher compared to the rest of the variables. Race (1.4%), sexual orientation (2.5%), and gender identity (0.8%) had the lowest documentation rates with a 97.5% missingness rate or higher. The correlation analysis for vendor type demonstrated that there was significant variation in the availability of marital and occupation information between vendors (\u03c72 > 6.0, P < 0.05). Variability in documentation between clinics indicated that the majority of characteristics exhibited high variation in completeness rates with the highest variation for occupation (median: 47.2, interquartile range: 60.6%) and marital status (median: 45.6, interquartile: 59.7%). Finally, physician sex, years since a physician graduated, and whether a physician was a foreign vs a Canadian medical graduate were significantly associated with documentation rates of place of birth, citizenship status, occupation, and education in the electronic medical records. Our findings suggest a crucial need to implement better documentation strategies for sociodemographic information in the healthcare setting. To improve completeness rates, healthcare systems should monitor, encourage, enforce, or incentivize sociodemographic data collection standards.",
